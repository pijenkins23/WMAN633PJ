abstract = {Catch-and-release angling is an increasingly popular conservation strategy employed by anglers voluntarily or to comply with management regulations, but associated injuries, stress and behavioural impairment can cause post-release mortality or fitness impairments. Because the fate of released fish is primarily determined by angler behaviour, employing ‘best angling practices' is critical for sustainable recreational fisheries. While basic tenants of best practices are well established, anglers employ a diversity of tactics for a range of fish species, thus it is important to balance science-based best practices with the realities of dynamic angler behaviour. Here we describe how certain tools and tactics can be integrated into recreational fishing practices to marry best angling practices with the realities of angling. While the effects of angling practices vary considerably across contexts and conditions, we also outline available methods for assessing fish condition by examining physical injuries and reflexes, which enable recreational anglers to make educated real-time decisions related to angling practices, as well as when, where, and whether to release captured fish based on their probability of survival. In cases where fish are in poor condition, there are recovery tactics available that can improve survival, although this is among the most understudied aspects of angling practices.},

abstract = {Current understanding of the stress response in fishes has largely come from studies of freshwater-adapted salmonids, with proportionately few comparative studies having examined marine fishes. The current study sought to quantify the magnitude of physiological disturbances, recovery dynamics, and post-exercise behaviour in bonefish (Albula vulpes; a tropical marine fish) exposed to several different exercise and air exposure regimens. Results showed that metabolic disturbances (lactate production, hyperglycemia) increased following exercise and exposure to air, and that the magnitude of metabolic disturbance was proportional to the duration of the stressful event. Fish required between 2-4 h to return to resting values. Exercise and exposure to air also resulted in significant increases in plasma Ca2+, Cl- and Na+, but the magnitude of these ionic changes did not vary with exercise or exposure to air duration and required over 4-h to return to baseline levels. Mortality following exercise was observed only for fish that had been exposed to air for 3 min and not in fish that had been exposed to air for 1 min. Together, results from this study provide a physiological basis for management strategies that can improve the post-release survival of bonefish that have been caught during a catch-and-release angling event. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {At present, there is a reasonable understanding of the independent effects of catch-and-release (C{\&}R) angling stressors, such as air exposure and water temperature, on endpoints such as physiological disturbance, behavioural impairment and mortality. However, little is known about the multiplicative or interactive nature of these different C{\&}R stressors. This study used bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) as a model to evaluate the combined effects of water temperature and air exposure on fish behaviour, equilibrium status and short-term mortality following C{\&}R. Experiments were replicated over 3 days with different ambient water temperatures (18.3, 22.8 and 27.4 °C). On each day, fish were captured by standard angling techniques, exposed to a range of air exposure durations (0, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480 and 960 s), and subsequently monitored for behavioural changes (within the first 300 s) and short-term (48 h) delayed mortality. Additional fish were captured by seine net for use as controls. There was an interactive effect of temperature and air exposure, whereby fish exposed to the highest temperature and longer air exposure durations lost equilibrium more often and had depressed ventilation rates relative to fish exposed to minimal air exposure and the lowest temperature. Immediate mortality at the lowest temperatures was negligible. However, significant delayed mortality (up to 80{\%}) was noted at the highest water temperature (27.4 °C) in fish exposed to the three longest air exposure groups. In addition, at 27.4 °C, mortality among fish exposed to 480 and 960 s occurred at a faster rate than in any other treatment group. These results indicate that at low to moderate water temperatures, extended air exposure for bluegill may result in little mortality. However, at high water temperatures, short-term mortality (within 48 h) can be substantial, especially for fish that experience extended air exposure durations. Anglers and managers must recognize that C{\&}R stressors can interact to have more dire consequences than when applied independently. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Creel and draining censuses were used to measure angling catch, harvest, and hooking mortality of tiger muskellunge (female muskellunge Esox masquinongy x male northern pike E. lucius ) in a 6.1-hectare Illinois impoundment dominated by largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides and bluegill Lepomis macrochirus . The vulnerability of tiger muskellunge to angling produced a substantial catch-and-release fishery: 226 hybrids stocked in 1981 and 1982 were caught 388 times (1.7 times per fish) during four fishing seasons, and 27 others were recovered in the draining census in 1985. Only four legal fish ( greater than or equal to 762 mm in total length) were harvested. Strict enforcement of a 762-mm minimum-length limit failed to generate a productive and cost-effective trophy fishery. The cost of each trophy fish harvested at Ridge Lake was prohibitively (US {\$}100). {\textgreater} 40{\%} of the hybrids stocked in 1981 and 1982 survived the first winter, and at least 19{\%} were alive in April 1985. Hooking mortality increased as water temperature increased and was not affected by type of bait or size of fish. Predation by tiger muskellunge on bluegill did not reduce bluegill density and hence had no apparent effect on growth, size structure, or angling catch of bluegill},

abstract = {Exposing fish to air following capture influences postrelease survival and behavior. Air exposure causes acute hypoxia and physical damage to the gill lamellae, resulting in physiological stress and physical damage that increases with air exposure duration. Air exposure duration is a relevant and easily quantified metric for both fishers and managers and can therefore provide a definitive benchmark for improving postrelease survival. Yet, fishers are rarely provided with specific recommendations other than simply to “minimize” air exposure. This is a subjective recommendation, potentially causing confusion and noncompliance. Here we discuss and summarize the literature regarding air exposure thresholds in both commercial and recreational fisheries, the factors influencing these thresholds, and identify knowledge gaps limiting our understanding of tolerance to air exposure in captured fish.},

abstract = {Research of catch-and-release fishing has included air exposure time as a contributing factor in the lethal and sublethal impacts to fish. However, to our knowledge, no studies have observed the amount of time anglers actually expose fish to air when recreationally fishing. We observed 280 anglers on several waters where catch and release was commonly practiced for trout and timed how long they exposed trout to air before releasing them back to the water. We also noted several angling characteristics to evaluate whether they influenced air exposure times, including the type of gear (fly, lure, bait), fishing on foot or from a boat, handling method (hand, net), and a subjective measure of trout size (small, medium, large). The longest continuous interval that anglers exposed trout to air averaged 26.1 s (range, 0-160 s), and only 4{\%}of the anglers held fish out of thewater continuously for {\textgreater}60 s. Total air exposure averaged 29.4 s, ranged from0 to 165 s, and differed from the longest air exposure by only 3.3 s because most of the released trout (78{\%}) were held out of the water only one time. Anglers who handled trout by hand (rather than using a landing net) and used flies (rather than bait or lures) held fish out of water for less time. Larger trout were exposed to air longer (x = 36.0 s) than small (x = 22.5 s) or medium-sized (x = 27.1 s) trout. However, no angling characteristic increased air exposure by more than 14 s. Fight time averaged 53.0 s and ranged from 7 to 128 s.We conclude that from an air exposure perspective, most of the trout released by anglers in our study were not exposed to air for times that would cause mortality or substantively increase sublethal effects from catch and release.},

Both factors were significant predictors (P {\textless} 0.0001) of hooking mortality. Striped bass hooking mortality was greater in fish captured with natural baits than with artificial baits and was positively related to water temperature. These results allow prediction of striped bass hooking mortality based on bait type and water temperature.

abstract = {Mortality and physiological responses of adult striped bass Morone saxatilis angled from Lake Murray, South Carolina, and held in live-release tubes were evaluated during the spring and summer of 2003. To estimate mortality, we attached external ultrasonic transmitters to 59 striped bass (mean total length [TL] ! 585 mm). Striped bass were caught with angling gear, tagged, and immediately released or held in live-release tubes for 2, 4, or 6 h prior to release. No mortality of striped bass was observed during spring. Overall mortality during summer was 83{\%}. Mortality of summer-caught striped bass was not related to tube residence time, fish TL, depth of capture, or surface water temperature. To characterize physiological stress, we measured the plasma cortisol, glucose, lactate, and osmolality levels of 62 additional striped bass (mean TL ! 563 mm) that were angled and immediately released or angled and held in live-release tubes. Plasma cortisol, glucose, lactate, and osmolality were positively related to tube residence time. When the hematological characteristics were considered only in relation to tube residence time, responses indicative of physiological stress continued for about 150 min, after which blood chemistry began to return to normal. Live-release tubes appear to be useful for keeping striped bass alive when they are angled from cool water, but they are not effective for striped bass angled from warm water. The high summer mortality of striped bass suggests a need for restrictive fishing regulations during the summer for the Lake Murray striped bass fishery.},

abstract = {The trophy ﬁsheries for Muskellunge Esox masquinongy in the northern U.S.A. and Canada often are developed and maintained by using high minimum-length limits (MLLs). However, the effectiveness of using such MLLs on southern-latitude Muskellunge populations, which have different rates of growth and mortality, warrants further research. The Muskellunge ﬁshery in the New River, Virginia, was managed under a 30-in (75 cm) MLL until 2006 when the MLL was increased to 42 in (105 cm) to increase the abundance of large Muskellunge. We measured ﬁshery quality before and after the institution of the 42-in MLL using size structure, average individual condition, rates of growth and mortality, and CPUE. We also assessed the potential of alternative length regulations (other MLLs and a 40–48-in protected-slot limit) to improve the population's size structure and trophy production using simulation models in the Fisheries Analyses and Modeling Simulator (FAMS) program. Following the institution of the 42-in MLL, we observed a 5-in increase in the average size of Muskellunge, an increase in the population's size structure with greater proportions of memorable-size individuals (≥42 in) and an increase in the abundance of memorable-size Muskellunge. However, declines in the average condition, i.e., relative weight (Wr), of large Muskellunge (≥38 in) suggest there is possible stockpiling of individuals just below the 42-in length limit. Higher MLLs (e.g., 48-in MLL) could further improve ﬁshery quality by increasing the survival of Muskellunge to large trophy sizes (≥50 in). However, managers should be wary of stockpiling under alternative MLLs as well. Furthermore, a higher MLL is unlikely to garner broad angler support in this system. Conversely, a protected-slot limit that allows the production of some trophy-sized Muskellunge while reducing the overall number of individuals, and that limits potential for stockpiling, may be a more agreeable regulatory option for New River ﬁshery managers. These ﬁndings and the methods described within this study may be useful for ﬁsheries managers working on other Muskellunge ﬁsheries in southern systems.},

abstract = {Landing nets used by recreational anglers can be constructed of a variety of different mesh materials. Anglers and fisheries managers have hypothesized that mesh type may affect injury rates and fish survival. To test this hypothesis, we used bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) as a model species to examine the effects of different net mesh types (rubber, knotless nylon, fine knotted nylon, coarse knotted nylon) on injury and mortality following angling at 26 °C. A control group consisted of individuals that were angled and held out of the water but not netted. Retention in a landing net for 30 s resulted in increased pectoral and caudal fin abrasion relative to control fish. Furthermore, evidence of dermal disturbance (i.e. scale and/or mucous loss) was more prevalent in netted fish than in control individuals. No control fish died during a 168 h holding period, whereas mortality rates ranged from 4 to 14{\%} for fish landed with nets, and the majority of mortality occurred between 48 and 96 h post-treatment. Fish that died exhibited impaired swimming behavior for approximately 24 h prior to death that was attributable to the extreme caudal fin erosion. Fish that died also had Saprolegnian lesions on the caudal peduncle that had begun to progress anteriorly toward the gills. Our results indicate that fish captured and landed by hand had lower injury rates than those fish landed using a net and experienced no mortality. Conversely, all net types resulted in heightened injury and mortality with the knotted mesh types being more injurious than the rubber or knotless mesh. This study supports the hypotheses that landing nets injure fish, and that mesh type alters the severity of injury. We urge further study using larger species of fish that are commonly landed using these gear types. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Mortality associated with catch-and-release (C{\&}R) fisheries is typically estimated as a single value associated with fish that are immediately released after capture. However, with the widespread use of smartphones by anglers, memorable or rare fish may be subjected to prolonged handling time for photographs and measurements, resulting in increased air exposure and subsequent increased potential for post-release mortality. In situations of overfishing, large fish become rarer and their memorable status may increase. This may create a depensatory cycle of additional handling and mortality. The combination of mortality from prolonged handling, immediate release, and illegal harvest is a cumulative C{\&}R-related cryptic mortality that may have population-level effects in high-effort sport fisheries. We investigated the potential post-release mortality of memorable-sized (average length of 60 cm) bull trout after simulating prolonged handling (involving photographing and measuring) and immediate release in a controlled angling study at a remote Albertan lake during summer. We found that handling time and air exposure of large bull trout subjected to photography and measurement was long (112 s) and associated post-release mortality was high (10 dead / 30 fish; 33 {\%} after 24 h observation). Immediate release mortality was also high (3 dead / 20 fish; 15 {\%}). These levels of mortality, combined with high angler effort, can potentially lead to population-scale declines at C{\&}R fisheries. The complexity and difficulty of population-scale and field-level measurements of cryptic mortality suggest that adaptive management experiments in reductions in angling effort and improved fish handling may be effective in increasing understanding of sustainable angling.},

abstract = {Recreational freshwater fisheries are key components of local economies in many regions. The quality of these fisheries can be affected not only by harvest but also by catch-and-release practices. Documenting catch and release among sport fish taxa is, therefore, important to fisheries researchers studying sport fishes and managers regulating these fisheries. We used an angler diary survey to assess taxon-specific effort, catch, harvest, release, and reason for release during the 2011 open-water season. Our study included information on 5,007 fishing trips taken by 652 anglers. These anglers visited 279 lakes spanning 11,761.5 km2 of northern Wisconsin. Muskellunge Esox masquinongy, black bass (i.e., Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu and Largemouth Bass M. salmoides), Northern Pike E. lucius, Walleye Sander vitreus, and panfish were released at rates of 99, 97, 86, 67, and 67{\%}, respectively, when targeted by anglers. This study is the first to document black bass catch-and-release rates in the region and corroborates previous findings of Muskellunge and Walleye catch-and-release rates based on creel surveys. Voluntary catch and release was the most common reason for release. Our findings suggest that regulations may be much more generous than the harvest rates practiced by anglers and that catch-and-release angling practices may be an important factor affecting these sport fish populations.

abstract = {Telemetry is an increasingly common tool for studying the ecology of wild fish, with great potential to provide valuable information for management and conservation. For researchers to conduct a robust telemetry study, many essential considerations exist related to selecting the appropriate tag type, fish capture and tagging methods, tracking protocol, data processing and analyses, and interpretation of findings. For telemetry-derived knowledge to be relevant to managers and policy makers, the research approach must consider management information needs for decision-making, while end users require an understanding of telemetry technology (capabilities and limitations), its application to fisheries research and monitoring (study design), and proper interpretation of results and conclusions (considering the potential for biases and proper recognition of associated uncertainties). To help bridge this gap, we provide a set of considerations and a checklist for researchers to guide them in conducting reliable and management-relevant telemetry studies, and for managers to evaluate the reliability and relevance of telemetry studies so as to better integrate findings into management plans. These considerations include implicit assumptions, technical limitations, ethical and biological realities, analytical merits, and the relevance of study findings to decision-making processes.},

abstract = {Most research on catch-and-release (CR) in recreational fishing has been conducted from a disciplinary angle focusing on the biological sciences and the study of hooking mortality after release. This hampers understanding of the complex and multifaceted nature of CR. In the present synopsis, we develop an integrative perspective on CR by drawing on historical, philosophical, socio-psychological, biological, and managerial insights and perspectives. Such a perspective is helpful for a variety of reasons, such as 1) improving the science supporting successful fisheries management and conservation, 2) facilitating dialogue between managers, anglers, and other stakeholders, 3) minimizing conflict potentials, and 4) paving the path toward sustainable recreational fisheries management. The present work highlights the array of cultural, institutional, psychological, and biological factors and dimensions involved in CR. Progress toward successful treatment of CR might be enhanced by acknowledging the complexity inherent in CR recreational fishing. Copyright {\textcopyright} Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

ConclusionA fish is chased with a net in an aquarium before being captured, scooped out of the water, and placed in a nearby testing arena. Is it stressed? How can we tell? Are our indicators reliable? Quantification of stress in fish has evolved from the initial development of radioimmunoassays to measure cortisol in plasma to the rapidly expanding suite of genome-based assays. Indicators range from the intracellular to whole-animal level. Expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and activity of metabolic enzymes can be paired with straightforward observations of reflexes and survival. Both traditional and emerging indicators have advantages and disadvantages, and their use is tissue- and context-specific. Ecological, biological, and methodological factors must be considered when selecting, measuring, and interpreting stress indicators. Inter- and intraspecific, sex, life stage, and temporal differences in physiological responses to stressors can confound confirmation of a stressed state. Despite numerous types of indicators, our understanding of how absolute levels of indicators relate to stressor severity and recovery to date remains limited. How accurately indicators characterize stress in wild populations naturally exposed to stressors is still an evolving discussion. The integration of research disciplines and involvement of stakeholders and user groups will aid in filling these knowledge gaps, as well as the translation of individual-level indicators to population- and ecosystem-level processes.},

After northern pike were held for five days in the gear comparison experiment, mortality rate of fish caught with: (1) double treble hook lures was zero, (2) large treble hook lures was 3.33 percent, (3) single hook lures was zero, and (4) small treble hook lures was 4.80 percent. In the multiple capture experiment no significant difference (P = 0.62) was detected in the distribution of hook placement among the three tackle types; no significant difference (P = 0.20) was detected in the distribution of bleeding caused by the three tackle types; and, the likelihood of bleeding was significantly greater (P = 0.05) for fish caught in the gills than for fish caught in other areas of the body. In the terminal tackle comparison experiment a significant difference (P {\textless} 0.001) was detected in the distribution of bleeding caused by the four terminal tackle types; the likelihood of bleeding was significantly greater (P {\textless} 0.001) for a fish caught with a small treble hook than for a fish caught with the other hook configurations; the likelihood of bleeding was also significantly greater (P {\textless} 0.001) for fish caught in the gills than for fish caught in other areas of the body; and, no significant difference (P = 0.13) was detected in the distribution of hook placement among the four tackle types.

abstract = {A unique population of muskellunge Esox masquinongy inhabits Shoepack Lake in Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota. Little is known about its status, dynamics, and angler exploitation, and there is concern for the long-term viability of this population. We used intensive sampling and mark-recapture methods to quantify abundance, survival, growth, condition, age at maturity and fecundity and angler surveys to quantify angler pressure, catch rates, and exploitation. During our study, heavy rain washed out a dam constructed by beavers Castor canadensis which regulates the water level at the lake outlet, resulting in a nearly 50{\%} reduction in surface area. We estimated a population size of 1,120 adult fish at the beginning of the study. No immediate reduction in population size was detected in response to the loss of lake area, although there was a gradual, but significant, decline in population size over the 2-year study. Adults grew less than 50 mm per year, and relative weight (W r) averaged roughly 80. Anglers were successful in catching, on average, two fish during a full day of angling, but harvest was negligible. Shoepack Lake muskellunge exhibit much slower growth rates and lower condition, but much higher densities and angler catch per unit effort (CPUE), than other muskellunge populations. The unique nature, limited distribution, and location of this population in a national park require special consideration for management. The results of this study provide the basis for assessing the long-term viability of the Shoepack Lake muskellunge population through simulations of long-term population dynamics and genetically effective population size. {\textcopyright} Copyright by the American Fisheries Society 2007.},

Microsatellite DNA variation was highly significant among all populations. A CLUSTER analysis identified K = 2 populations corresponding to populations east and west of the Ohio River. This may be a consequence of different management practices by Ohio and West Virginia or may suggest that the Ohio River is a substantial barrier to gene flow.

Simultaneously, IMOS developed a centralised national database to foster collaborative research across the user community and quantify individual behaviour across a broad range of taxa. Here we present the database and quality control procedures developed to collate 49.6 million valid detections from 1891 receiving stations. This dataset consists of detections for 3,777 tags deployed on 117 marine species, with distances travelled ranging from a few to thousands of kilometres. Connectivity between regions was only made possible by the joint contribution of IMOS infrastructure and researcher-funded receivers. This dataset constitutes a valuable resource facilitating meta-analysis of animal movement, distributions, and habitat use, and is important for relating species distribution shifts with environmental covariates.},

Previous studies retaining angler-caught fish are useful in understanding delayed mortality but have associated limitations. As an alternative to tournament mortality studies, we estimated daily apparent survival rates of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides using a modified Cormack-Jolly-Seber model in Program MARK to test for the duration of delayed tournament mortality and to identify important covariates affecting survival. Multiple monotonic trends were evaluated to test acute (2, 3, 4, or 7 d) and chronic (15 or 30 d) delayed mortality hypotheses. The most supported models revealed an acute trend in survival following tournament capture but no support for chronic mortality. Largemouth bass survival decreased with increases in water temperature and the number of tournament capture events. Combined, these factors resulted in up to 90{\%} cumulative mortality at temperatures of 18.8 °C for individuals captured at five tournament events. Our results confirm the potential for high delayed mortality associated with catch and release fishing tournaments. Using mark-recapture data to understand tournament fishing mortality can be a valuable tool in managing highly fished systems.},

abstract = {Although much is known about the factors that influence the effects of catch-and-release angling on fish condition and survival, relatively little is known about the effects of fishing gear strength on fight time and, hence, fish condition. Moreover, little is known about how gear strength and fight time interact with air exposure duration to ultimately influence the level of exhaustion experienced by fish at time of release. Here we systematically varied fishing gear strength (ultralight versus medium-heavy) and air exposure duration (0 versus 120 s) when targeting Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides. We relied on reflex impairment (using five different reflexes) as a real-time indicator of fish condition. Largemouth Bass fight durations were highly variable between fishing gear types and across fish sizes. Largemouth Bass captured on ultralight fishing gear experienced longer fight times, and there was a stronger positive relationship between fish length and fight time than for those captured on heavier fishing gear. However, fish captured using ultralight gear were easier to handle upon landing and thus experienced shorter hook removal times, which may result in less air exposure in actual angling scenarios. Fish captured with ultralight gear had significantly higher reflex impairment than those captured with heavy gear with no air exposure, while fish captured with both gear types had similarly high reflex impairment when exposed to the air. These results indicate that gear strength does influence the level of exhaustion experienced by Largemouth Bass. However, fish that are landed quickly are so vigorous that handling and hook removal are challenging. We submit that there is likely a compromise where neither ultralight nor ultraheavy gear (always relative to the size and species targeted) is appropriate. Moreover, our findings emphasize the importance of minimizing air exposure, particularly for fish that are exhausted already from a protracted fight.

abstract = {Catch-and-release (CR) has become a pervasive practice and “social norm” with anglers for some inland recreational fisheries. This practice has been promoted for fish conservation and to meet angler and manager desires of greater fish abundances, angler catch rates, and trophy growth potential. Catch-and-release in north-temperate inland recreational fisheries was reviewed over time and documented the subsequent responses of fish populations to the practice in catch rates, recruitment, abundance, size structure, growth, and trophy potential primarily focusing on black bass Micropterus spp., muskellunge Esox masquinongy, walleye Sander vitreus, and panfish (sunfishes Lepomis spp., crappies Pomoxis spp., yellow perch Perca flavescens). This review suggested that angler and manager desires may not be met when fisheries are almost exclusively CR, CR may create situations where managers are unable to structure fish communities to meet such desires, and CR can cause imbalances in fisheries managed for multiple species. Because CR may be one of the biggest challenges facing inland recreational fisheries management in the 21st century and beyond, recommendations and future research considerations are provided and aimed to alleviate concerns identified from this review to better balance fisheries, meet angler and manager desires, and to keep fisheries within a safe operating space.},

abstract = {Over the past 20 years, there has been a dramatic increase in the use of physiological tools and experimental approaches for the study of the biological consequences of catch-and-release angling practices for fishes. Beyond simply documenting problems, physiological data are also being used to test and refine different strategies for handling fish such that stress is minimised and survival probability maximised, and in some cases, even for assessing and facilitating recovery post-release. The inherent sensitivity of physiological processes means that nearly every study conducted has found some level of - unavoidable - physiological disturbance arising from recreational capture and subsequent release. An underlying tenet of catch-and-release studies that incorporate physiological tools is that a link exists between physiological status and fitness. In reality, finding such relationships has been elusive, with further extensions of individual-level impacts to fish populations even more dubious. A focus of this article is to describe some of the challenges related to experimental design and interpretation that arise when using physiological tools for the study of the biological consequences of catch-and-release angling. Means of overcoming these challenges and the extrapolation of physiological data from individuals to the population level are discussed. The argument is presented that even if it is difficult to demonstrate strong links to mortality or other fitness measures, let alone population-level impacts of catch-and-release, there remains merit in using physiological tools as objective indicators of fish welfare, which is an increasing concern in recreational fisheries. The overarching objective of this paper is to provide a balanced critique of the use of physiological approaches in catch-and-release science and of their role in providing meaningful information for anglers and managers. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Upon further review, this sentence would be more accurate if it read "A detailed assessment of injury and short-term ({\textless}48 h) mortality was conducted for bonefish handled with a mechanical lip-gripping device for 30 s either while being restrained horizontally in water or held vertically in the air. A control group was also handled, but only with bare hands. Although no fish died after 48 h, the lip-gripping device caused mouth injuries to 80{\%} of bonefish restrained in the water and 100{\%} of bonefish held in the air, always when fish thrashed while being held. Some of the injuries were severe (40{\%}) and included separating the tongue from the floor of the mouth, creating tears and holes in the soft tissue of the lower jaw, and splitting the mandible. Anglers should use caution when using mechanical lip-gripping devices for bonefish, at least until additional studies are conducted to help tease apart how the risk of injury using mechanical lip-gripping devices on less exhausted individuals compares to the risk of post-release mortality for fish exercised to exhaustion. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

abstract = {Telemetry is an increasingly common tool for studying the ecology of wild fish, with great potential to provide valuable information for management and conservation. For researchers to conduct a robust telemetry study, many essential considerations exist related to selecting the appropriate tag type, fish capture and tagging methods, tracking protocol, data processing and analyses, and interpretation of findings. For telemetry-derived knowledge to be relevant to managers and policy makers, the research approach must consider management information needs for decision-making, while end users require an understanding of telemetry technology (capabilities and limitations), its application to fisheries research and monitoring (study design), and proper interpretation of results and conclusions (considering the potential for biases and proper recognition of associated uncertainties). To help bridge this gap, we provide a set of considerations and a checklist for researchers to guide them in conducting reliable and management-relevant telemetry studies, and for managers to evaluate the reliability and relevance of telemetry studies so as to better integrate findings into management plans. These considerations include implicit assumptions, technical limitations, ethical and biological realities, analytical merits, and the relevance of study findings to decision-making processes.},

abstract = {Many recreational anglers practice catch-and-release angling, where fish are returned to the water with the presumption that they will survive. However, not all fish survive, and those that do often experience sublethal consequences including injury and stress. There is compelling scientific evidence that angler behavior and gear choice can affect the success of catch-and-release as a management and conservation strategy. Because anglers often look to government natural resource agencies for guidance on how to handle and release fish properly, there is a need to assess whether their outreach materials are readily accessible and provide the necessary and correct information on the subject. Therefore, on-line catch-and-release guidelines developed by state and provincial natural resource agencies across North America were evaluated to determine whether their guidelines were consistent with the best available scientific information. This analysis revealed that there was immense variation in the depth and breadth of coverage among jurisdictions. Agency guidelines contradicted one another in several areas including air exposure, angling in deep water, venting trapped gases, and resuscitation. In many cases, the guidelines failed to provide sufficient direction to actually be of use to anglers or provide direction consistent with contemporary scientific literature. This analysis will assist with developing outreach materials that promote sustainable recreational fisheries and in maintaining the welfare status of individual fish. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Catch-and-release recreational angling has become very popular as a conservation strategy and as a fisheries management tool for a diverse array of fishes. Implicit in catch-and-release angling strategies is the assumption that fish experience low mortality and minimal sub-lethal effects. Despite the importance of this premise, research on this topic has focused on several popular North American sportfish, with negligible efforts directed towards understanding catch-and-release angling effects on alternative fish species. Here, we summarise the existing literature to develop five general trends that could be adopted for species for which no data are currently available: (1) minimise angling duration, (2) minimise air exposure, (3) avoid angling during extremes in water temperature, (4) use barbless hooks and artificial lures/flies, and (5) refrain from angling fish during the reproductive period. These generalities provide some level of protection to all species, but do have limitations. Therefore, we argue that a goal of conservation science and fisheries management should be the creation of species-specific guidelines for catch-and-release. These guidelines would take into account the inter-specific diversity of fishes and variation in fishing techniques. As recreational angling continues to grow in popularity, expanding to many developing countries, and targeting alternative species, it is important that reasonable data appropriate for specific fish and fisheries are available. The sustainable use and conservation of recreational fishery resources will depend upon the development and dissemination of effective catch-and-release angling strategies based upon sound science to stakeholders around the world. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.},

abstract = {Mortality and physiological responses of adult striped bass Morone saxatilis angled from Lake Murray, South Carolina, and held in live-release tubes were evaluated during the spring and summer of 2003. To estimate mortality, we attached external ultrasonic transmitters to 59 striped bass (mean total length [TL] ! 585 mm). Striped bass were caught with angling gear, tagged, and immediately released or held in live-release tubes for 2, 4, or 6 h prior to release. No mortality of striped bass was observed during spring. Overall mortality during summer was 83{\%}. Mortality of summer-caught striped bass was not related to tube residence time, fish TL, depth of capture, or surface water temperature. To characterize physiological stress, we measured the plasma cortisol, glucose, lactate, and osmolality levels of 62 additional striped bass (mean TL ! 563 mm) that were angled and immediately released or angled and held in live-release tubes. Plasma cortisol, glucose, lactate, and osmolality were positively related to tube residence time. When the hematological characteristics were considered only in relation to tube residence time, responses indicative of physiological stress continued for about 150 min, after which blood chemistry began to return to normal. Live-release tubes appear to be useful for keeping striped bass alive when they are angled from cool water, but they are not effective for striped bass angled from warm water. The high summer mortality of striped bass suggests a need for restrictive fishing regulations during the summer for the Lake Murray striped bass fishery.},

abstract = {The potential utility of pelvic fin rays as ageing structures was evaluated for southern US muskellunge Esox masquinongy Mitchill populations by comparing age estimates among three readers and against cleithrum estimates, and by comparing observed length changes of tagged fish with changes predicted from growth equations based on pelvic fin ray age estimates. Mean coefficient of variation in age estimates among all readers and between the two readers with prior ageing experience was 17.8{\%} and 5.6{\%}, respectively. Exact and within 1-year agreement rates between pelvic fin rays and cleithra were 76{\%} and 100{\%}, respectively. Mean (± 2 SE) estimated absolute error between observed and predicted length changes for 13 tagged muskellunge was 30 ± 14 mm. This evaluation indicated that pelvic fin rays may prove to be a useful, non-lethal method for ageing muskellunge in southern US waters. Validation studies are still needed to ensure that growth rings form consistently throughout fish's life span. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Authors.

abstract = {Electronic tags have become a common tool in fish research, enhancing our understanding of how fish interact with their environment and move among different habitats, for estimating mortality and recording internal physiological states. An often-untested assumption of electronic tagging studies is that tagged fish are representative of untagged conspecifics and thus show ‘normal' behaviour (e.g. movement rates, swimming activity, feeding). Here, we use a unique data set for potamadromous walleye (Sander vitreus) in Lake Huron and Lake Erie tributaries to assess whether the lack of appropriate controls in electronic tagging could seriously affect behavioural data. We used fish tagged in previous years and compared their migratory behaviour during the spawning season to fish tagged in a current year at the same location. The objective of the study was to determine whether intracoelomic acoustic tag implantation altered downstream movement of walleye after spawning. Fish tagged in a given season travelled slower downstream from two river spawning sites than fish tagged in previous years. Fish tagged one or two years earlier showed no differences between each other in downstream travel time, in contrast to fish tagged in a given year. Our results support notions that standard collection and intracoelomic tagging procedures can alter short-term behaviour (i.e. days, weeks, months), and as such, researchers should use caution when interpreting data collected over such time periods. Further, whenever possible, researchers should also explicitly evaluate post-tagging effects on behaviour as part of their experimental objectives.},

abstract = {This paper consolidates and summarizes information on Ontario muskellunge, Esox masquinongy, sport fisheries derived from angler diary programs sponsored by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (OMNR) and Muskies Canada Incorporated (MCI) from 1979 to 2004. Interest in muskellunge as a sport fish has increased substantially over the past 10-15 years. Muskellunge catches were found to be highly correlated with angling effort. Catch rates, expressed in terms of catch-per-unit-of-effort (CUE), have improved over the past decade to the point where, in 2001, the provincial CUE was 0.119. The long term catch rate is 0.069. This improvement in angling quality is attributed to new minimum size limit regulations and increased catch-and-release angling practices. Over the period from 1979-2004, release rates by muskellunge anglers have averaged 94{\%}. Based on a sample size of 9,499 fish, the mean size of angled muskellunge over the past 26 years was 37.0 inches (94 cm). Numerous fish exceeding 50 inches (127 cm) are angled from Ontario waters each year. The incidence of lymphosarcoma, a highly contagious, malignant blood cancer, has averaged only 2{\%} since 1979. Based on an analysis of this information, Ontario's muskellunge fisheries appear to be stable and sustainable. Volunteer angler diary programs provide an accurate and cost-effective means to monitor the status of muskellunge fisheries in Ontario.},

Partial fin clips were used as a secondary mark.  the lakes were sampled during the following year, and 73 fish with fin clips were recovered in a sample of 271 fish.  The one-year tag retention rate was 90.4{\%} in the two lakes.  Six fish without functional tags were examined for the presence of broken or malfunctioning tags, and all were missing tags.

For researchers to conduct a robust telemetry study, many essential considerations exist related to selecting the appropriate tag type, fish capture and tagging methods, tracking protocol, data processing and analyses, and interpretation of findings. For telemetry-derived knowledge to be relevant to managers and policy makers, the research approach must consider management information needs for decision-making, while end users require an understanding of telemetry technology (capabilities and limitations), its application to fisheries research and monitoring (study design), and proper interpretation of results and conclusions (considering the potential for biases and proper recognition of associated uncertainties). To help bridge this gap, we provide a set of considerations and a checklist for researchers to guide them in conducting reliable and management-relevant telemetry studies, and for managers to evaluate the reliability and relevance of telemetry studies so as to better integrate findings into management plans. These considerations include implicit assumptions, technical limitations, ethical and biological realities, analytical merits, and the relevance of study findings to decision-making processes.},

abstract = {Reproduction of muskellunge Esox masquinongy has failed in many waters that formerly sup- ported self-sustaining populations. Laboratory experiments were conducted to isolate causes of such failures. Differential mortality occurred among lots of muskellunge eggs incubated in jars of unaerated lake water over substrates of sand, gravel, silt, aquatic macrophytes, wood, tree leaves, polyethylene screen, and bare glass. High and rapid early mortality (days 1-2), attributable to low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations (0-0.1 rag/liter), occurred among eggs incubated on leaves and macrophytes. After day 3, Saprolegnia sp. fungus was implicated in high egg mortalities in jars with inorganic substrates and moderate DO concentrations (3.8-4.1 mg/liter). Lowest mortality rates occurred on organic substrates (silt and wood) amidst intermediate DO concentrations (0.4-1.7 mg/liter) and limited fungal infestation. Among eight midwestern lakes and reservoirs, measured DO at the substrate-water interface in four of them was high (means, 6.0-8.4 mg/liter) and showed little microstratification; these lakes contain self-sustaining mus- kellunge populations. The other four lakes showed extreme DO microstratification and virtual anoxia (means, 0.4-2.4 mg/liter) at the substrate-water interface; muskellunge populations in these lakes are supported almost wholly by stocking. Suitable spawning substrates in these lakes are aerated by annual reservoir drawdown, have inherently low biological oxygen demand, or support dense beds of stonewort Chara sp. Reproductive failure is associated with spawning areas having deep accumulations of organic matter and dense macrophyte growth. Improvements of spawning habitat to prevent or alleviate hypoxia are among the options available to manage this species.},

This controversy has persisted for several years, yet veterinarians have been mostly absent from the discussion so far. This essay aims to address this issue. Here, it is argued that while this controversy has its place, it is unlikely to be resolved in the near future. Fish welfare could instead be improved by pursuing more clinically applicable research to increase knowledge of fishes' behavior and physiology. Such research would assist in learning the optimal environment for their specific needs, as well as compiling some verified indicators of pain in fish. This would then lead to improved studies that could help to determine if and when analgesic drugs can be beneficial in fish, as they are in many other species.},

abstract = {The generalized energy budget for fish (i.e., Energy Consumed = Metabolism + Waste + Growth) is as relevant today as when it was first proposed decades ago and serves as a foundational concept in fish biology. Yet, generating accurate measurements of components of the bioenergetics equation in wild fish is a major challenge. How often does a fish eat and what does it consume? How much energy is expended on locomotion? How do human-induced stressors influence energy acquisition and expenditure? Generating answers to these questions is important to fisheries management and to our understanding of adaptation and evolutionary processes. The advent of electronic tags (transmitters and data loggers) has provided biologists with improved opportunities to understand bioenergetics in wild fish. Here, we review the growing diversity of electronic tags with a focus on sensor-equipped devices that are commercially available (e.g., heart rate/electrocardiogram, electromyogram, acceleration, image capture). Next, we discuss each component of the bioenergetics model, recognizing that most research to date has focused on quantifying the activity component of metabolism, and identify ways in which the other, less studied components (e.g., consumption, specific dynamic action component of metabolism, somatic growth, reproductive investment, waste) could be estimated remotely. We conclude with a critical but forward-looking appraisal of the opportunities and challenges in using existing and emerging electronic sensor-tags for the study of fish energetics in the wild. Electronic tagging has become a central and widespread tool in fish ecology and fisheries management; the growing and increasingly affordable toolbox of sensor tags will ensure this trend continues, which will lead to major advances in our understanding of fish biology over the coming decades.},

Laboratory studies have yielded mixed results regarding catchand- release impacts on fish growth. These studies do not adequately capture the scales of stress and variability of a natural system. We used a 27-year mark-recapture study of 1050 individually tagged largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) to determine the effects of catch-and-release angling on the growth in a natural setting. Individual bass were angled one to six times per season. Recapture intervals ranged from 1 to 98 days. Largemouth bass exhibited a post-release period ({\~{}}6 days) of weight loss. Following this weight loss, we observed a subsequent period of compensatory growth facilitating recovery to normal weight. We found that catch-and-release angling had little impact on the overall seasonal growth patterns of largemouth bass and therefore should have limited adverse effects on growth-dependent ecological functions.},

abstract = {Telemetry can inform many scientific and research questions if a context exists for integrating individual studies into the larger body of literature. Creating cumulative distributions of post-tagging evaluation metrics would allow individual researchers to relate their telemetry data to other studies. Widespread reporting of standard metrics is a precursor to the calculation of benchmarks for these distributions (e.g., mean, SD, 95{\%} CI). Here we illustrate five types of standard post-tagging evaluation metrics using acoustically tagged Blue Catfish (Ictalurus furcatus) released into a Kansas reservoir. These metrics included: (1) percent of tagged fish detected overall, (2) percent of tagged fish detected daily using abacus plot data, (3) average number of (and percent of available) receiver sites visited, (4) date of last movement between receiver sites (and percent of tagged fish moving during that time period), and (5) number (and percent) of fish that egressed through exit gates. These metrics were calculated for one to three time periods: early ({\textless}10 d), during (weekly), and at the end of the study (5 months). Over three-quarters of our tagged fish were detected early (85{\%}) and at the end (85{\%}) of the study. Using abacus plot data, all tagged fish (100{\%}) were detected at least one day and 96{\%} were detected for {\textgreater} 5 days early in the study. On average, tagged Blue Catfish visited 9 (50{\%}) and 13 (72{\%}) of 18 within-reservoir receivers early and at the end of the study, respectively. At the end of the study, 73{\%} of all tagged fish were detected moving between receivers. Creating statistical benchmarks for individual metrics can provide useful reference points. In addition, combining multiple metrics can inform ecology and research design. Consequently, individual researchers and the field of telemetry research can benefit from widespread, detailed, and standard reporting of post-tagging detection metrics.},

abstract = {The intracoelomic surgical implantation of telemetry transmitters in fish is becoming the "standard" tagging approach for most field telemetry studies. Subsequently, efforts must be made to ensure the welfare of the fish are maintained and that fish do not experience significant mortality or sublethal impairments in health, behavior or physiology as a result of surgical procedures. Therefore, it is essential to adequately report information relating to all aspects of the surgical procedure to enable the reader to make an accurate interpretation of study results. We conducted a quantitative literature review aimed at characterizing trends in data reporting by examining a sample of fish telemetry studies published in peer-reviewed outlets during the last 20 years. We used a repeatability score, based on 16 predetermined criteria, to evaluate the reporting of surgical procedures in telemetry studies. The majority of studies failed to report basic information relating to the surgical procedures used. Repeatability scores were highly variable between studies and ranged from 0-93.8{\%}. No single study provided complete information (mean repeatability score = 50.7{\%}) and repeatability showed no trend over time. Some study information was consistently well reported (e. g. tag size and dimensions, the type of anaesthetic used and the location of incision). In contrast, the type of suture knots, duration or level of anaesthesia and precautions taken to minimize infection were consistently left out of the methods section of most telemetry studies. Our review was confounded by the large proportion of studies that cited other sources for their surgical methods, many of which themselves lacked complete information. We recommend that future electronic tagging studies that involve intracoelomic implantation include the minimum reporting standards presented in this paper. Increasing the detail of reporting will improve the quality of data presented, minimize welfare and ethical concerns and allow transparency for study repeatability. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Pike pre-equipped with acoustic transmitters were angled and exposed to a handling protocol including measurements of length and mass. Pike not recaptured constituted an unhandled control group. Results demonstrated that the handling protocol caused temperature-dependent changes in pike activity, with higher temperatures leading to lower activity of the recaptured pike. The effects, however, were transitory and not detectable after 48-h post-release. These findings indicate that pike are relatively resilient to handling and quickly resume pre-handling activity. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

Recovery times varied significantly by the electrosedation treatment used, but all fish recovered within 2 min postinduction. Changes in blood chemistry were consistent with an acute stress response, but these effects were transient and no differences were observed among the electrosedation treatments. Results suggest that pulsed direct current electrosedation is an effective strategy for quickly and easily sedating juvenile hybrid striped bass and potentially other species of conservation or management concern.},

abstract = {Although many local and regional variables structure fish assemblage composition, few studies have assessed the effects of aquatic connectivity on fish assemblages in wetlands. Fish and habitat surveys were conducted in 12 wetlands across the lower Great Lakes basin in the spring and fall of 2003 and 2004. Spatial and temporal connectivity were classified into four connectivity classes to evaluate the interaction between aquatic connectivity and fish assemblage structure. Sequential, nested analysis of covariance was used to model the effect of habitat area and connectivity at long- and short-term time scales on aggregate descriptors of assemblage structure (i.e., species richness, piscivore richness, abundance, and diversity). Although no species-area relationship was detected, increases in connectivity were shown to positively affect species richness and piscivore richness. A variation decomposition method indicated that a combination of aquatic connectivity, followed by environmental and area variables, was most influential in structuring fish assemblages at short-term time scales. Connectivity thus influences both the local species pool present, as well as the abundance of these species within a wetland. Future fundamental and applied studies (e.g., climate change predictions, impact of humans on water budget, wetland management) on wetland fish assemblages should include connectivity as an important structuring process.},

abstract = {Publication FH -508 – 2010 Muskellunge Management PURPOSE The purpose of this report is to provide Department biologists and anglers with current information on Wisconsin's muskellunge fishery and associated management activities. MANAGEMENT Designated the state fish in 1955, Muskellunge are found in lakes of all sizes and in slower water of large rivers, generally occupying areas with abundant submerged aquatic plants. The heart of the range is north central Wisconsin, although they are found in many other locations throughout the state; nearly 90{\%} of muskellunge waters occur in the Northern Region. Muskellunge are the largest predatory game fish found in Wisconsin. They are sleek, powerful predators, known to feed on virtually every fish species, as well as aquatic birds and mammals. Because of their large size and predatory nature, muskellunge are usually present at low densities, with most waters generally containing less than 1 adult per acre. Long hours are often required to catch a muskellunge; however, most avid anglers are more than willing to invest the time required to encounter a muskellunge. Muskellunge are managed as a trophy fish in Wisconsin. This means restricting the harvest through relatively high length limits and low daily bag limits to promote the occurrence of large fish in the population. Only hook and line fishing is allowed for muskellunge. Restrictions on trolling (originally developed to reduce muskellunge harvest) also exist in many waters throughout the state. Fishing regulations for muskellunge are varied, depending upon the growth potential of the population and public support for high length limits. The current statewide minimum length limit is 34 " , which applies to approximately 75{\%} of all muskellunge waters (see Fishing Regulations, below, for a more detailed breakdown of length limits). The daily bag limit for muskellunge is 1 on all waters statewide except Yellowstone Lake, Lafayette County, where the daily bag limit is 0, and Escanaba Lake, Vilas County, where there is no daily bag limit. The open season for muskellunge north of US Hwy. 10 (Northern Zone) is from the Saturday nearest Memorial Day to November 30, except on Escanaba Lake, Vilas County, which has a continuous open season with no size limit or daily bag limit. The open season south of US Hwy. 10 (Southern Zone) is from the first Saturday in May to November 30. A variety of fish refuges designed to protect vulnerable concentrations of spawning muskellunge exist throughout the state. Natural reproduction has always been relatively low and has been presumed to be declining, making stocking an important management strategy in some waters, especially for populations that are totally dependent on continued stocking. The economic impact of muskellunge fishing in Wisconsin is substantial. A 2006 US Fish and Wildlife Service report estimated that 1.4 million anglers fishing in Wisconsin spent {\$}1.7 billion on fishing (fishing trips, equipment, etc.). We estimate that about 25{\%} of anglers fish for muskellunge. So, about 5.3 million angler-days are spent fishing for muskellunge each year. A rough estimate of expenditures would be {\$}425 million spent directly on muskellunge fishing in Wisconsin. This does not include indirect economic impacts, such as wages and tax revenue.},

While there is anecdotal evidence, there are only a few studies on the economics of commercial aquaponics. In this study, we collect economic and production information from three aquaponic farms to investigate the economic feasibility of an aquaponics industry in Hawaii. Based on the information supplied by the farms, we develop a model case to analyze (i) profitability, (ii) return on investment, and (iii) input requirements for small-scale commercial aquaponics operation in Hawaii. We find that small-scale commercial aquaponics is economically feasible, but our findings are not as optimistic as those previously published. The modified internal rate of return of the model farm is 7.36{\%}. We conduct sensitivity and decision reversal analysis to investigate how output prices and operational cost parameters affect the overall economic outcome. We find that economic outcome is very sensitive to output price. Investment in commercial aquaponics cannot be supported if annual sales revenue falls by 11{\%}. We conclude by discussing challenges and risks faced by commercial aquaponic farms and the potential economic gain from organic certification and renewable energy implementation.},

abstract = {Most animals experience temperature variations as they move through the environment. For ectotherms, in particular, temperature has a strong influence on habitat choice. While well studied at the species level, less is known about factors affecting the preferred temperature of individuals; especially lacking is information on how physiological traits are linked to thermal preference and whether such relationships are affected by factors such feeding history and growth trajectory. This study examined these issues in the common minnow Phoxinus phoxinus, to determine the extent to which feeding history, standard metabolic rate (SMR) and aerobic scope (AS), interact to affect temperature preference. Individuals were either: 1) food deprived (FD) for 21 days, then fed ad libitum for the next 74 days; or 2) fed ad libitum throughout the entire period. All animals were then allowed to select preferred temperatures using a shuttle-box, and then measured for SMR and AS at 10 °C, estimated by rates of oxygen uptake. Activity within the shuttle-box under a constant temperature regime was also measured. In both FD and control fish, SMR was negatively correlated with preferred temperature. The SMR of the FD fish was increased compared with the controls, probably due to the effects of compensatory growth, and so these growth-compensated fish preferred temperatures that were on average 2{\textperiodcentered}85 °C cooler than controls fed a maintenance ration throughout the study. Fish experiencing compensatory growth also displayed a large reduction in activity. In growth-compensated fish and controls, activity measured at 10 °C was positively correlated with preferred temperature. Individual fish prefer temperatures that vary predictably with SMR and activity level, which are both plastic in response to feeding history and growth trajectories. Cooler temperatures probably allow individuals to reduce maintenance costs and divert more energy towards growth. A reduction in SMR at cooler temperatures, coupled with a decrease in spontaneous activity, could also allow individuals to increase surplus AS for coping with environmental stressors. In warming climates, however, aquatic ectotherms could experience frequent fluctuations in food supply with long-lasting effects on metabolic rate due to compensatory growth, while simultaneously having limited access to preferred cooler habitats.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The use of internal telemetry has greatly advanced fisheries research in the past two decades, permitting researchers to observe movements and distributions of organisms in their natural environment. For many years, the prevailing opinion has been that internal tags should not weigh more than 2{\%} of the dry body weight of a fish. Some studies indicate that tags weighing up to 12{\%} dry body weight do not have a negative effect on swimming performance, but few authors have examined impacts to fish physiology and health. This study investigated how tags greater than 2{\%} body mass affected the mortality, tag retention, swimming performance, and physiological indicators of stress in brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis Mitchill).RESULTS:No mortality was observed between treatment groups, but tag retention was lowest in the heavy tag treatment group in which 80{\%} (12 fish) lost tags. Swimming performance and physiological indices of stress were not significantly impacted by tag mass. Fish tagged with heavy tags showed slower growth in the 3weeks after tagging, but growth rates appeared to recover by the end of the study, although this result may be confounded by tag loss.CONCLUSION:The results of this study suggest that for brook trout, the 2{\%} rule is a highly conservative guideline that can be substantially extended but should not exceed 7{\%} body weight due to concerns about tag retention.},

abstract = {U se of electronic transmitter and monitoring systems to track movements of aquatic animals has increased continuously since the inception of these systems in the mid-1950s. The purpose of the present report is to provide information about veterinary principles and their incorporation into surgical implantation procedures for fish. We also intend to provide insight into the unique challenges of field-based aquatic surgical studies. Within this context, 4 aspects of the process for surgical implantation of transmitters in fish (ie, handling, aseptic technique, anesthesia, and implanta-tion) will be described. Effects of surgical insertion of transmitters (ie, tagging) and aspects of the surgical im-plantation process where collaboration and professional exchanges among nonveterinarian researchers and veterinarians may be most fruitful will be discussed. Although this report focuses on surgical implantation, the principles and protocols described here (other than incision and suture placement) are also applicable to studies that involve injection of transmitters into fish. A Brief History of Fish Telemetry The earliest use of telemetry in fish dates to 1956, when cumbersome electronic backpacks were externally attached to adult coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). 1 Soon thereafter, the transmitter package was made smaller and the capabilities of the transmitter were expanded. Within 2 decades, telemetry techniques were firmly established and in common use throughout the world. By 1975, researchers were tagging hundreds of individuals from 40 fish species. 2 Since then, telem-etry has been used to investigate the movements of tens of thousands of fish as well as the movements of aquatic mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates. 2 Both sonic (also known as acoustic) and radio technologies were used in the earliest telemetry investigations. Sonic transmitters were used in both freshwater and marine environments. However, early sonic models were not extremely effective in turbulent environments because air bubbles attenuated the acoustic signal. Radio signals were effective in freshwater, even in a highly turbulent , air-enriched environment; however, radio signals were rapidly attenuated in saltwater. Both radio and sonic transmitters consisted of electronic components and a battery potted in epoxy or encapsulated within a watertight casing. Most radio transmitters also possessed a trailing antenna to increase transmission range. A common attachment method for both types of transmitters involved threading pins, wires, or sutures attached to a transmitter through the dorsal muscula-ture of a fish. Alternatively, a transmitter was inserted into the stomach of a fish (gastric implant). Gastric insertion of a radio transmitter with an antenna required that the antenna be positioned such that the free end of the antenna exited the fish' s mouth. As telemetry was applied to more species, new external attachment methods were developed to accommodate a variety of body forms and habitats. 3 With the advent of long-lived, miniaturized acoustic transmitters in the 1970s, fish researchers used surgical implantation as a means of transmitter attachment. Implantation of transmitters directly into the body cavity had several advantages, including eliminating motion hindrance for fish with externally mounted equipment and reducing transmitter loss associated with external attachment or gastric implantation (through regurgitation). 4 The first attempts at surgical implantation of transmitters into fish were reported in 1975. 5 Acoustic transmitters were used, and various su-ture materials and suturing techniques were evaluated. Results for flathead catfish (Pylodictis olivaris), large-mouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), and striped bass (Morone saxatilis) in that study 5 formed the basis for most surgical methods currently in use. Soon thereafter, new techniques were attempted for surgical implantation of radio transmitters with a trailing antenna. Initial attempts involved coiling the antenna and implanting it within the peritoneum. 6 However, researchers modified this technique so that the antenna exited through the body wall and trailed alongside the fish to improve signal propagation and thus detection range. A shielded-needle technique was devised to reduce the risk of damaging internal organs during this step and to improve postoperative recovery and healing. 7 At that time, recommendations were ABBREVIATIONS},

To date, however, there has been no actual evaluation of the consequences of using such a device on the health and survival of the fish. Using wild adult bonefish (Albula spp.) as the test organism, we assessed the impact of a commonly used mechanical lip-gripping device on fish injury, behavior, and survival in a seawater laboratory. Upon further review, this sentence would be more accurate if it read "A detailed assessment of injury and short-term ({\textless}48 h) mortality was conducted for bonefish handled with a mechanical lip-gripping device for 30 s either while being restrained horizontally in water or held vertically in the air.

Some of the injuries were severe (40{\%}) and included separating the tongue from the floor of the mouth, creating tears and holes in the soft tissue of the lower jaw, and splitting the mandible.

Old Woman Creek is a freshwater: estuary on the southern share of Lake Erie and has been recognized as an important nursery area for fish. Although there is no point source of mercury to the wetland, there is evidence of biomagnification of mercury in the food web. Mercury concentrations in water were not detectable ({\textless} 20 ng/L) by methods used in this study. The sediments had a mean concentration of 0.04 $\mu$g total Hg/g wet weight. Zooplankton, benthos, and macrophytes had less than O. 05 $\mu$g total Hg/g wet weight, but mean concentrations in fish tissue ranged from 0.001 to 0.636 $\mu$g total Hg/g wet weight. There was a positive correlation between mercury concentration and both length and weight in channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus and common carp Cyprinus carpio. In general, channel catfish accumulated higher levels of mercury than common carp, suggesting that the pelagic food web may be more efficient in delivery of mercury (to channel catfish) than the benthic pathway (to common carp). The highest value for fish occurred in a bowfin Amia calva. Tissue from one great blue heron Ardea herodias had the highest concentration at 1.62 $\mu$g total Hg/g wet weight. In this system, as in others, top predators tended to accumulate the highest mercury levels and were therefore most susceptible to mercury poisoning, even at sublethal levels.},

We found no significant differences in recovery times related to species or mass, nor did we find any significant changes to recovery time when changing voltage applied, frequency, shocking duration, or when changing the type of pulse applied (e.g., burst pulses vs. standard pulse). Although further researches are needed to address the sublethal and long-term effects of eletrosedation, these findings are important to researchers for selecting suitable target species and optimizing recovery time and survival for a quick release after surgery, tagging, or any time fish sedation is required.},

abstract = {Black bass Micropterus spp. support popular freshwater sport fisheries in North America. Bass anglers commonly adopt catch and release as a conservation practice, and frequently over 75{\%} of angled black bass are released back into the water. If fish survive the angling event, the practice of catch and release as an alternative to harvest reduces direct mortality, but it has the potential to affect the postrelease feeding behavior and survival of the fish. The act of lifting black bass for handling, hook removal, and photograph opportunities may cause stress and injury, and the degree of injury sustained could be influenced by fish size. Holding fish in a tilted grip by the jaw has raised concern among anglers about potential damage to jaw musculature and tendons, as they may not support the fish's body weight out of water, particularly for trophy bass. We conducted an experiment with Florida Largemouth Bass M. salmoides floridanus to evaluate the relative differences in survival, jaw mechanics, and feeding success after the use of three common handling treatments: (1) a vertical hold using a lip-grip device (vertical treatment); (2) a tilted, one-handed grip using only the lower jaw (horizontal treatment); and (3) two-handed support to the lower jaw and body (support treatment). The time taken by fish to regain equilibrium and resume normal swimming behavior after handling differed among the three treatments; the recovery period was shortest for fish in the support treatment (mean ± SD = 7 ± 10 s; vertical treatment: 33 ± 74 s; horizontal treatment: 12 ± 16 s). Minor injuries (e.g., abrasions and sores) and diseases (e.g., tumors and fungus) tended to increase after handling across the entire sample. Results suggested no evidence of handling-specific differences in fish feeding behavior, jaw adjustments, and mortality after release. However, based on our results, we recommend that anglers use two-handed support to handle Florida Largemouth Bass, thus minimizing the mean amount of time for an individual fish to regain equilibrium after an angling event.},

abstract = {Global population growth will increase pressures on current food systems in order to supply adequate protein and produce to the increasingly urban world population. The environmental impact of food production is a critical area of study as it influences water and air quality, ecosystem functions, and energy consumption. Aquaponics (in which seafood and vegetables are grown in a closed-loop system) has the potential to reduce the environmental impact of food production. A review of the current environmental and economic considerations is provided in order to identify current research gaps. Research gaps exist with respect to 1) diversity of aquatic and plant species studied; 2) inconsistent bounds, scope, and lifetime across studies; 3) diverse allocation of the environmental and economic impacts to the coproducts; 4) scale of systems considered; 5) transportation of produced food; and 6) presence of heavy metals, pests, and pathogens with human health implications. These aspects require increased attention to close the existing gaps prior to widescale deployment of these systems for increased sustainable food production toward satisficing human needs.

To make such decisions, planners and managers must articulate more clearly the purposes of parks, what is valued, and what needs to be sustained. A key aim for conservation today is the maintenance and restoration of biodiversity, but a broader range of values are also likely to be considered important, including ecological integrity, resilience, historical fidelity (ie the ecosystem appears and functions much as it did in the past), and autonomy of nature. Until recently, the concept of "naturalness" was the guiding principle when making conservation-related decisions in park and wilderness ecosystems. However, this concept is multifaceted and often means different things to different people, including notions of historical fidelity and autonomy from human influence. Achieving the goal of nature conservation intended for such areas requires a clear articulation of management objectives, which must be geared to the realities of the rapid environmental changes currently underway. We advocate a pluralistic approach that incorporates a suite of guiding principles, including historical fidelity, autonomy of nature, ecological integrity, and resilience, as well as managing with humility. The relative importance of these guiding principles will vary, depending on management goals and ecological conditions. {\textcopyright} The Ecological Society of America.},

We also determined whether fin location (anal or pelvic), fin ray number, and preparation methods affected accuracy and precision. Lastly, we determined whether von Bertalanffy growth parameters estimated from fin ray ages were similar to parameters estimated from known ages. Precision and accuracy of age estimates from anal and pelvic rays were similar and estimates were relatively precise (coefficient of variation = 8.5{\%}) and accurate (mean absolute difference from known age = 0.85 years) for ages 4–15, but ages were overestimated for younger fish and underestimated for older fish. Growth models based on estimated age were similar to models based on known age. Anal and pelvic rays offer a nonlethal alternative for age estimation of muskellunge ages 4–15 and for producing reliable estimates of growth.},

abstract = {Abstract The purpose of the present study was to characterize the surgical methods researchers use to implant telemetry transmitters in fish and obtain their opinions on fish surgical techniques. The majority of respondents (74{\%}) use monofilament suture to close transmitter incisions, mirroring recent findings that monofilament can help reduce tissue inflammation and promote wound healing. An equal number also believe that maintaining sterile equipment between surgeries is important to preserve fish health. Despite the difficulty of maintaining sterile surgical equipment and surgery areas in field conditions, this opinion does coincide with those of veterinarians. Opinions about what component of surgery is the most hazardous for fish were mixed: 37{\%} believed it to be the initial incision, closely followed by wound closure (23{\%}), insertion of the transmitter and its components (22{\%}), and anesthesia and the handling of the fish (18{\%}). A large proportion (73{\%}) of researchers practice at least occasionally to maintain or improve their surgical skills. The fact that approximately 18{\%} of fish surgeons do not practice was a surprise. Although responses regarding any observations between surgical experience/volume and outcome (e.g., survival) were disparate, the majority (69{\%}) of respondents identified this as an important research area. Furthermore, the majority of researchers (62{\%}) believed it was important to use the individual surgeon for each fish as a covariate when analyzing the data obtained during a study involving multiple surgeons. Despite the variety of practices and opinions of fish surgeons, the majority of responses conformed with or promoted the use of surgical techniques that would benefit the health and welfare of fish. This information should help fisheries researchers refine their surgical techniques and assist governing agencies in forming important regulations on laboratory and field surgical procedures.},

When samples were small and inadequate (11), we used concordance sum of squares to match growth and give an interim estimate from the adequately sampled source with the best growth match. In Ontario populations, mean ultimate total lengths range widely: from 81.4 to 140.0 cm for females and from 70.7 to 115.9 cm for males. Females can be grouped into three types of growth, producing either large-, medium-, or small-bodied fish (ranging from 140 to 127 cm, 126 to 114 cm, and 113 to 102 cm and smaller, respectively). We describe and categorize growth and growth potential to establish standards for detecting change in exploitation and for reviewing minimum size limits (currently underway) based on growth biology to help sustain and even increase the size of muskellunge populations while producing high-quality trophy fisheries},

Our findings suggested that when FHGs were used, fish tended to remain still (i.e., to show full reflex impairment) during handling relative to controls. Fish that were held with FHGs showed negligible reflex impairment immediately after the electricity was terminated. After a 30-min posttreatment retention period, blood chemistry and ventilation rates were similar between fish held with FHGs and those held with bare hands. This study supports the notion that electric FHGs are a safe and effective tool for practitioners who need to temporarily immobilize fish for handling, enumeration, or performing various scientific procedures.},

becoming increasingly common; as such, fish typically must be sedated

no widely available, immediate-release chemical sedative currently
exists in NorthAmerica, we investigated the feasibility of using
electricity to sedate Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush long enough for an
experienced surgeon to implant an electronic transmitter (i.e., 180 s).
Specifically, our study objectives were to determine (1) whether some
combination of electrical waveform characteristics (i.e., duty cycle,
frequency, voltage, and pulse type) could sedate Lake Trout for at least
180 s; and (2) whether Lake Trout that were sequentially exposed to
continuous DC and pulsed DC had greater rates of spinal injury and
short-term mortality than control fish. A Portable Electrosedation
System unit was used to sedate hatchery and wild Lake Trout.
Dual-frequency pulsed-DC and two-stage approaches successfully sedated
Lake Trout and had similar induction and recovery times. Lake Trout
sedated using the two-stage approach did not have survival rates or
spinal abnormalities that were significantly different from those of
control fish. We concluded that electricity was a viable alternative to

This practice has been promoted for fish conservation and to meet angler and manager desires of greater fish abundances, angler catch rates, and trophy growth potential. Catch-and-release in north-temperate inland recreational fisheries was reviewed over time and documented the subsequent responses of fish populations to the practice in catch rates, recruitment, abundance, size structure, growth, and trophy potential primarily focusing on black bass Micropterus spp., muskellunge Esox masquinongy, walleye Sander vitreus, and panfish (sunfishes Lepomis spp., crappies Pomoxis spp., yellow perch Perca flavescens). This review suggested that angler and manager desires may not be met when fisheries are almost exclusively CR, CR may create situations where managers are unable to structure fish communities to meet such desires, and CR can cause imbalances in fisheries managed for multiple species. Because CR may be one of the biggest challenges facing inland recreational fisheries management in the 21st century and beyond, recommendations and future research considerations are provided and aimed to alleviate concerns identified from this review to better balance fisheries, meet angler and manager desires, and to keep fisheries within a safe operating space.},

abstract = {Use of live bait for angling of muskellunge, Esox masquinongy, is popular in Wisconsin. A traditional method utilizes a large hook through the bait fish's snout, which requires the muskellunge to swallow the bait prior to hook set. Adult muskellunge ({\textgreater}76 cm; 30 in) were held in lined hatchery ponds and caught while fishing with live bait on 10/0 size single hooks. The leader was cut and the muskellunge was released when hooked in the stomach. Survival was monitored for up to 1 year. No immediate ( {\textless}24 h) mortality occurred. However, 22{\%} of hooked muskellunge died within 50 days and 83{\%} died within 1 year. Necropsies revealed extensive trauma to the stomach and other organs from hooks, along with systemic bacterial infections. Highest mortality on both hooked and control fish occurred over winter through spring. This peak mortality may be associated with natural stressors that occur during the spring spawning period. Mortality rates observed in this study are considered unacceptable for trophy management of muskellunge.

abstract = {Analgesics are an integral part of routine pain management in mammals, yet their use in fish is still limited. Some recommendations on the use of analgesics in fish are currently in the literature; however, information on the properties of analgesic drugs in most fish species is still scarce and sometimes misleading. The present review of information on the use of analgesics in fish was thus compiled to help clinicians make an informed decision as to which drug and dose to use. The main agents that have been investigated are opioids, NSAID, and local anesthetics, primarily in rainbow trout and zebrafish. There is presently no overwhelming evidence of efficacy for most analgesics in fish, although beneficial effects on behavior and physiologic parameters have been reported in many instances, especially associated with morphine administration. Furthermore, most analgesics did not result in significant adverse side effects. Thus, analgesics could be administered whenever it is considered that an animal might experience pain, given that the drugs appear not to cause harm and may be beneficial. However, caution must be advised because 1) important interspecies variation has been reported and 2) unforeseen effects could affect experimental results. Further research is needed to investigate analgesic use in fish. This should be accompanied by research aimed at improving our knowledge of the various species of fish. The current lack of a validated approach to assessing pain in fish limits our ability to evaluate the efficacy of analgesics in fish.},

abstract = {The effect of predator density on per capita ingestion rates in two estuarine predators, age-0 bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix L.) and age-1 striped bass (Morone saxatilis W.), was examined in a 121,000-l research aquarium. Group size treatments were 3, 6, 12, and 24 predators; each treatment was provided with 100 prey (mummichog killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus L.) during a 22-h feeding trial. The behaviors of predator and prey were recorded. Predator type and group size had a significant effect on per capita ingestion rates. Bluefish had significantly higher per capita ingestion rates compared to striped bass. For bluefish, per capita ingestion rate was highest in the three predator group, while for striped bass, individuals in the six predator treatment had the highest ingestion rates. From these maxima, per capita ingestion rate values declined to their lowest values in the 24 predator treatment for both species. Several factors that may be responsible for lowered per capita ingestion rates at higher group sizes include predator interference, prey depletion, and anti-predator behaviors of prey. For juvenile bluefish and striped bass being a member of a relatively large group may lead to decreased individual ingestion rates. Given that large group sizes of these species occur in nature, we conclude that these foraging costs must be outweighed by benefits of group membership. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Merwe et al. Key factors affecting metapopulation dynamics of animals include patch size, isolation, and patch quality. For wetland-associated species, hydrology can affect patch availability, connectivity, and potentially habitat quality; and therefore drive metapopulation dynamics. Wetlands occurring on natural river floodplains typically have more dynamic hydrology than anthropogenic wetlands. Our overall objective was to assess the multiyear spatial and temporal variation in occupancy and turnover rates of a semi-aquatic small mammal at two hydrologically distinct wetland complexes. We live-trapped marsh rice rats (Oryzomys palustris) for 3 yr and {\textgreater}50 000 trap nights at nine wetland patches on the Mississippi River floodplain and 14 patches at a reclaimed surface mine in southern Illinois. We used dynamic occupancy modeling to estimate initial occupancy, detection, colonization, and extinction rates at each complex. Catch per unit effort (rice rats captured/1000 trap nights) was markedly higher at the floodplain site (28.1) than the mining site (8.1). We found no evidence that temperature, rainfall, or trapping effort affected detection probability. Probability of initial occupancy was similar between sites and positively related to patch size. Patch colonization probability at both sites was related negatively to total rainfall 3 weeks prior to trapping, and varied across years differently at each site. We found interacting effects of site and rainfall on extinction probability: extinction increased with total rainfall 3 months prior to trapping but markedly more at the floodplain site than at the mining site. These site-specific patterns of colonization and extinction are consistent with the rice rat metapopulation in the floodplain exhibiting a habitat-tracking dynamic (occupancy dynamics driven by fluctuating quality), whereas the mineland complex behaved more as a classic metapopulation (stochastic colonization {\&} extinction). Our study supports previous work demonstrating metapopulation dynamics in wetland systems being driven by changes in patch quality (via hydrology) rather than solely area and isolation.},

Female Muskellunge had a larger mean asymptotic length (49.8 in) than did males (43.4 in). Minimum ultimate size of female Muskellunge (45.0 in) equaled the 45.0-in minimum length limit, but was less than the 50.0-in minimum length limit used on Wisconsin's trophy waters, while the minimum ultimate size of male Muskellunge (34.0 in) was less than the statewide minimum length limit. Minimum reproductive sizes for both sexes were less than Wisconsin's trophy minimum length limits. Mean growth potential of female Muskellunge in northern Wisconsin appears to be sufficient for meeting trophy management objectives and angler expectations. Muskellunge in northern Wisconsin had similar growth potential to those in Ontario populations, but lower growth potential than Minnesota's populations, perhaps because of genetic and environmental differences.},

abstract = {Capture–mark–recapture models are useful tools for estimating demographic parameters but often result in low precision when recapture rates are low. Low recapture rates are typical in many study systems including fishing-based studies. Incorporating auxiliary data into the models can improve precision and in some cases enable parameter estimation. Here, we present a novel application of acoustic telemetry for the estimation of apparent survival and abundance within capture–mark–recapture analysis using open population models. Our case study is based on simultaneously collecting longline fishing and acoustic telemetry data for a large mobile apex predator, the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorhynchus cepedianus), at a coastal site in Tasmania, Australia. Cormack–Jolly–Seber models showed that longline data alone had very low recapture rates while acoustic telemetry data for the same time period resulted in at least tenfold higher recapture rates. The apparent survival estimates were similar for the two datasets but the acoustic telemetry data showed much greater precision and enabled apparent survival parameter estimation for one dataset, which was inestimable using fishing data alone. Combined acoustic telemetry and longline data were incorporated into Jolly–Seber models using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. Abundance estimates were comparable to those with longline data only; however, the inclusion of acoustic telemetry data increased precision in the estimates. We conclude that acoustic telemetry is a useful tool for incorporating in capture–mark–recapture studies in the marine environment. Future studies should consider the application of acoustic telemetry within this framework when setting up the study design and sampling program.},

abstract = {The development of small acoustic transmitters has enabled researchers to monitor earlier life stages and smaller fish species than was previously possible. The underlying assumptions of any telemetry study are minimal tag loss and negligible effects on the behavior, survival, and growth of tagged individuals. To that end, tag retention, healing, survival, specific growth rates, and behavior were evaluated for 96 age-0 Muskellunge Esox masquinongy (TL [mean ± SD] = 205 ± 10 mm) from three treatment groups. Tagged fish were compared to untagged controls and sham fish (fish that had undergone anesthesia and laparotomy but not transmitter implantation). Thirty-two fish (tagged group) were implanted with one of the smallest commercially available acoustic transmitters (Juvenile Salmon Acoustic Telemetry tag; 12.0 × 5.3 × 3.7 mm, 0.217 g in air, {\textgreater}120-d tag life) and monitored in a 4-month, overwinter tank experiment. Tricaine methanesulfonate was used for anesthesia, incisions were closed with a synthetic absorbable monofilament, and all surgeries were conducted by a single trained researcher. All tags were retained throughout the experiment; surgical wounds healed within 30 d, 32{\%} of sutures were retained at 120 d postsurgery, and survival did not differ between treatments. No biologically significant effects of tagging on mean relative growth rates (percent change in weight/d) were observed among the three groups (tagged, untagged, and sham fish) at 4 months postprocessing. The reaction of tagged fish to a moving object within 15 minutes after tagging was slower than the reaction at 7 d postsurgery, reiterating the importance of testing appropriate sedation methods prior to releasing fish in field studies. Results validate the utility of surgical implantation of small acoustic transmitters in juvenile Muskellunge for future studies, although immobilization methods for early life stages require further study.},

abstract = {Natural mortality can substantially affect fish population dynamics, but the rate is difficult to estimate because natural deaths are rarely observed and it is difficult to separate the effects of natural and fishing mortality on abundance. We developed a new telemetry approach for estimating natural and fishing mortality rates and applied it to the population of striped bass Morone saxatilis in Lake Gaston, North Carolina and Virginia. Our analyses were based on a sample size of 51 telemetered striped bass that were known to be alive and in Lake Gaston at least 1 month after capture and surgery. Relocations of live fish and fish that died of natural causes were used to estimate natural and fishing mortality rates and the probability of relocating telemetered fish. Fishing mortality rates varied seasonally, but few natural deaths were observed, so the best model incorporated a constant annual instantaneous natural mortality rate (M; +/- SE) of 0.14 +/- 0.02. With the uncertainty in model selection accounted for, the average annual M was 0.16 +/- 0.04 For 1997 and 0.12 +/- 0.04 for 1998. Estimated annual fishing mortality rates (F) were 0.74 +/- 0.13 for 1997 and 0.34 +/- 0.18 for 1998. This telemetry approach for estimating mortality rates does not rely on angler reporting of tagged fish. The relative standard errors for;M (24-33{\%}) were comparable to those obtained from traditional ragging methods with large sample sizes. This approach is most applicable in closed systems, where fishing mortality estimates are not biased by emigration. A high relocation probability is critical to reliably establishing seasonal changes in mortality.},

Fish subjected to these treatments were monitored for induction (where appropriate) and recovery time andwhether these forms of anesthesia were conducive to implanting telemetry transmitters, that is, whether they fit a surgery threshold range of 250–350 s. Additionally, all fish were monitored for posttrial survival, and radiographs were taken to determine whether any vertebral damage was associated with the electroanesthesia treatments.Although all anesthetic treatments successfully immobilized fish for enough time to implant a transmitter, PDC electroanesthesia is recommended because of its immediate induction time, quick recovery, high immediate and short-term survival, and lack of evidence of vertebral abnormalities.},

Initial mortality decreased significantly (P {\textless} 0.0001) between the 1970s (19.5{\%}), and the 1980s (6.6{\%}) and 1990s (6.5{\%}). I found no difference in initial mortality (P = 0.9885) between the 1980s and 1990s. Delayed mortality was 10.4{\%} in the 1970s based on limited data. Estimates of delayed and total mortality for the 1980s (20.9{\%} and 26.2{\%}, respectively) and 1990s (23.3{\%} and 28.3{\%}, respectively) were not significantly different (P greater than or equal to 0.7222). Thus, no evidence exists of a decline in initial, delayed, or total mortality since at least the mid-1980s. This suggests that recommendations made by previous researchers for reducing tournament-associated mortality were disregarded or ineffective. Meta-analysis of correlations shows a strong positive relationship between water temperature, and initial ((r) over bar = 0.51 +/- 0.00) and delayed mortality (r = 0.36 +/- 0.000). There was a strong negative relationship between tournament size and initial mortality ((r) over bar = -0.54 +/- 0.000), and a moderately strong positive relationship with delayed mortality ((r) over bar = 0.30 +/- 0.000). I also found a moderately strong but nonsignificant positive relationship between fish size and initial mortality ((r) over bar = 0.31 +/- 0.197), and a moderately weak negative relationship with delayed mortality ((r) over bar = -0.13 +/- 0.056). Nonlinear regression of initial, delayed, and total mortality on water temperature for tournaments conducted during 1980-1996 explained 20{\%}-30{\%} of the variation in mortality. Initial mortality appears to be compensatory in its effect on total mortality. Estimates of initial mortality alone provide no information on the magnitude of total tournament-associated mortality; therefore, both initial and delayed mortality must be measured. These results also suggest that a substantial portion of tournament-associated mortality is the result of injuries sustained during hooking, playing, and landing of fish.},

abstract = {We review studies claiming that fish feel pain and find deficiencies in the methods used for pain identification, particularly for distinguishing unconscious detection of injurious stimuli (nociception) from conscious pain. Results were also frequently misinterpreted and not replicable, so claims that fish feel pain remain unsubstantiated. Comparable problems exist in studies of invertebrates. In contrast, an extensive literature involving surgeries with fishes shows normal feeding and activity immediately or soon after surgery. C fiber nociceptors, the most prevalent type in mammals and responsible for excruciating pain in humans, are rare in teleosts and absent in elasmobranchs studied to date. A-delta nociceptors, not yet found in elasmobranchs, but relatively common in teleosts, likely serve rapid, less noxious injury signaling, triggering escape and avoidance responses. Clearly, fishes have survived well without the full range of nociception typical of humans or other mammals, a circumstance according well with the absence of the specialized cortical regions necessary for pain in humans. We evaluate recent claims for consciousness in fishes, but find these claims lack adequate supporting evidence, neurological feasibility, or the likelihood that consciousness would be adaptive. Even if fishes were conscious, it is unwarranted to assume that they possess a human-like capacity for pain. Overall, the behavioral and neurobiological evidence reviewed shows fish responses to nociceptive stimuli are limited and fishes are unlikely to experience pain. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {We reviewed the literature in an attempt to determine the importance of aseptic technique when implanting electronic tags in fish. Given that there was negligible information on this topic we embarked on a study where bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) were used as a model to investigate the effects of different aseptic surgical techniques for the intracoelomic implantation of electronic tags in fish. First we tested the effects of water entry into the incision using five treatments: lake, distilled and saline water introduced into the incision, water-free controls, and non-surgery controls. For fish in the water treatments, 1 mL of the sample was introduced into their coelom prior to incision closure. Fish were held for 10 days to monitor survival and at the end of the study, the survivors were blood sampled and euthanized to evaluate condition and health using the health assessment index. In a second experiment, four aseptic treatments were used: non-sterile, field-based, high-grade sterility, and non-surgery controls and fish were monitored as in the first experiment. For both experiments, no differences in physiological status, health or mortality were noted among treatment groups. However, in the aseptic techniques experiment, surgical times were approximately twice as long for fish in the sterile treatment as compared to other groups and the costs of surgical supplies was greater than that of the less-sterile treatments. Although we failed to document any benefit of keeping water out of the incision or using aseptic technique for bluegill, in other situations and for other species, such approaches may be important. As such, we encourage fish surgeons practicing intracoelomic implants to attempt to prevent water entry into the coelom. We also encourage, at least some level of infection control (e. g., non-sterile gloves, clean tags and surgical tools) consistent with good veterinary practices to maintain the welfare status of tagged fish and ensure that the data from tagged fish representative of untagged conspecifics. However, the most prudent and ethical approach would be to work with veterinarians to incorporate formal sterilization procedures, equipment (e. g., sterile gloves) and aseptic technique into field surgical techniques. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Although muskellunge, Esox masquinongy, fisheries in northern US states and Canadian provinces are increasingly being managed by introduction of restrictive harvest regulations (e.g. 1370-mm (54″) minimum length limits), many southern US muskellunge fisheries continue to be managed with comparatively liberal regulations (e.g. 762-mm (30″) minimum length limits) that are implemented statewide. We studied the population dynamics of the New River, Virginia, muskellunge fishery and used predictive modeling to determine whether restrictive harvest regulations also might prove beneficial for this southern latitude fishery. A creel survey was also conducted to learn more about angler attitudes to the New River muskellunge fishery. Muskellunge grew quickly, with fish reaching harvestable lengths (762 mm, 30″) in 2-3 years. Muskellunge fishing pressure, harvest rates, and voluntary release rates were low compared with reports for more northern areas. Most anglers, irrespective of how often they fished for muskellunge, defined "trophy" muskellunge to be approximately 1050-1100 mm (41-43″) in length. Although angler support for restrictive harvest regulations was low, abundance of memorable-length (≥1070 mm, 42″) muskellunge was predicted to increase under all evaluated length limits. Muskellunge yield would remain static at 914-mm (36″) and 1016-mm (40″) length limits, because of the rapid growth of fish, but yield would decline dramatically with a 1143-mm (45″) length limit, because male muskellunge rarely exceeded 1100 mm (43″). Because of rapid growth and low release rates, implementation of higher length limits (e.g. 965-1067 mm, 38-42″) may indeed prove beneficial for augmenting "trophy" muskellunge production on the New River. Angler support for higher minimum length limits might be increased by educating anglers about the rapid growth rates of muskellunge and the expected size structure changes that will result from a length-limit increase. Size structure changes resulting from an increase in the minimum length limit may be difficult to detect because of potential increases in fishing pressure or reduced fish growth as a result of competition for food resources. Long-term monitoring of muskellunge growth and angling pressure may therefore be needed to ensure that new regulations are indeed benefitting the fishery. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

This is in part because of the ongoing controversy as to whether or not fish feel pain. This controversy has persisted for several years, yet veterinarians have been mostly absent from the discussion so far. This essay aims to address this issue. Here, it is argued that while this controversy has its place, it is unlikely to be resolved in the near future. Fish welfare could instead be improved by pursuing more clinically applicable research to increase knowledge of fishes' behavior and physiology. Such research would assist in learning the optimal environment for their specific needs, as well as compiling some verified indicators of pain in fish. This would then lead to improved studies that could help to determine if and when analgesic drugs can be beneficial in fish, as they are in many other species.},

abstract = {Abstract: Fish and plant assemblages in the highly modified Crane Creek coastal wetland complex of Lake Erie were sampled to characterize their spatial and seasonal patterns and to examine the implications of the hydrologic connection of diked wetland units to Lake Erie. Fyke netting captured 52 species and an abundance of fish in the Lake Erie–connected wetlands, but fewer than half of those species and much lower numbers and total masses of fish were captured in diked wetland units. Although all wetland units were immediately adjacent to Lake Erie, there were also pronounced differences in water quality and wetland vegetation between the hydrologically isolated and lake-connected wetlands. Large seasonal variations in fish assemblage composition and biomass were observed in connected wetland units but not in disconnected units. Reestablishment of hydrologic connectivity in diked wetland units would allow coastal Lake Erie fish to use these vegetated habitats seasonally, although connectivity does appear to pose some risks, such as the expansion of invasive plants and localized reductions in water quality. Periodic isolation and drawdown of the diked units could still be used to mimic intermediate levels of disturbance and manage invasive wetland vegetation.},

IACUCs may, however, lack the knowledge and experience to evaluate fish projects judiciously, especially when the projects are in field settings. Surgeries involving implantation of transmitters and other instruments into the coelom, which now comprise a very common research tool in the study of free-ranging fishes, are examples of surgeries that use a broad spectrum of surgical and anesthetic techniques, some of which would not be considered acceptable for similar work on mammals. IACUCs should apply the standards they would expect to be used for surgeries on homeotherms to surgeries on fish. Surgeons should be carefully trained and experienced. Surgical instruments and transmitters should be sterile. Regulations and laws on the use of drugs in animals should be followed, particularly those concerned with anesthetics and antibiotics used on free-ranging fish. Exceptions to surgical procedures should be made only when circumstances are extreme enough to warrant the use of less than optimal procedures.},

abstract = {Understanding animal home ranges and other patterns of space utilisation is an important component of spatial ecology. It allows researchers to explore and explain site occupation and habitat preferences, and also interaction and avoidance behaviour. Conventional analyses of animal home ranges use points at which the animals are observed, sometimes weighted by the time difference between sequential observations. This creates an issue in that the analysis can assign undue weight to a sample point with a long time delay from the previous observation, as the full path from the preceding point is implicitly assigned to that point. Conventional analyses also do not take into account physical constraints such as boundaries (e.g. rivers, roads, cliffs) or the cost of traversing alternate possible paths between points, typically inferring a straight-line path between sequential samples. This conventional approach has obvious limitations, especially in constrained environments such as for fish in rivers and estuaries. These limitations can be attributed in large part to a lack of available software tools. In this paper we describe a software tool we have developed that calculates kernel density estimates of occupation times by using the per-segment transit times along a path inferred using a cost surface that is constrained to remain between defined boundaries. To illustrate the functionality of the tool we use a data set of Argyrosomus japonicus (Mulloway) movements, an estuarine fish species, sampled from the Georges River estuary in Sydney, NSW. The approach is, however, generic and can be applied to any environment where animal movements are constrained, for example fragmented agricultural landscapes. The tool is written using the ESRI arcpy system, but is open source so can readily be ported to other GIS software packages.},

abstract = {Trade-offs in energy allocation between growth and reproduction can result in variations in reproductive potential in fish with differing growth patterns. Spawning biomass is often used as a proxy for reproductive potential on the assumption that fecundity is directly proportional to body weight. We examined variations in the reproductive potential of Atka mackerel Pleurogrammus monopterygius by studying the effect of differential growth and condition patterns on fecundity, atresia, and egg energy. Fecundity and egg energy were determined for fish from two geographic areas, Seguam Pass and Amchitka Island, Alaska, and compared with those of fish held in captivity. These Atka mackerel showed distinct differences in growth and condition, with weight at length and length at age being the highest among captive fish, intermediate among fish from Seguam Pass, and lowest among fish fromAmchitka Island. Realized fecundity showed that on average captive fish spawned seven batches, fish fromSeguam Pass six batches, and fish fromAmchitka Island five batches. For wild fish, potential and realized fecundity at length or age was significantly higher at Seguam Pass than at Amchitka Island, whereas the fecundity-at-weight relationship did not differ by area, suggesting that weight is a better predictor of fecundity than length or age. Atresia and batch fecundity by length or weight did not differ by area, suggesting that the variation in fecundity is better explained by the variation in batch number than by batch size. Oocyte dry weight was higher for captive fish than for wild fish, whereas batch order did not significantly affect oocyte dry weight. Increased potential fecundity, realized fecundity, and oocyte quality in Atka mackerel females were strongly related to body size, indicating that growth differences and maternal feeding success impact the fecundity and oocyte quality of Atka mackerel. Therefore, changes in growth and condition patterns need to be taken into account to accurately estimate the reproductive potential of this species. {\textcopyright} American Fisheries Society 2011.},

Basic science studies using animal models of inflammation show changes in the peripheral nervous system, as well as in the spinal cord and descending inhibitory pathways, in response to TENS. Translational studies show mechanisms to prevent analgesic tolerance to repeated application of TENS. This review also highlights data from recent randomized, placebo-controlled trials and current systematic reviews. Clinical trials suggest that adequate dosing, particularly intensity, is critical to obtaining pain relief with TENS. Thus, evidence continues to emerge from both basic science and clinical trials supporting the use of TENS for the treatment of a variety of painful conditions while identifying strategies to increase TENS effectiveness.},

While including the same capabilities as previous versions, Fish Bioenergetics 4.0 allows for timely updates and bug fixes and can be continuously improved based on feedback from users. In addition, users can add new or modified parameter sets for additional species and formulate and incorporate modifications such as habitat-dependent functions (e.g., dissolved oxygen, salinity) that are not part of the default package.

abstract = {At present, there is a reasonable understanding of the independent effects of catch-and-release (C{\&}R) angling stressors, such as air exposure and water temperature, on endpoints such as physiological disturbance, behavioural impairment and mortality. However, little is known about the multiplicative or interactive nature of these different C{\&}R stressors. This study used bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) as a model to evaluate the combined effects of water temperature and air exposure on fish behaviour, equilibrium status and short-term mortality following C{\&}R. Experiments were replicated over 3 days with different ambient water temperatures (18.3, 22.8 and 27.4 °C). On each day, fish were captured by standard angling techniques, exposed to a range of air exposure durations (0, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480 and 960 s), and subsequently monitored for behavioural changes (within the first 300 s) and short-term (48 h) delayed mortality. Additional fish were captured by seine net for use as controls. There was an interactive effect of temperature and air exposure, whereby fish exposed to the highest temperature and longer air exposure durations lost equilibrium more often and had depressed ventilation rates relative to fish exposed to minimal air exposure and the lowest temperature. Immediate mortality at the lowest temperatures was negligible. However, significant delayed mortality (up to 80{\%}) was noted at the highest water temperature (27.4 °C) in fish exposed to the three longest air exposure groups. In addition, at 27.4 °C, mortality among fish exposed to 480 and 960 s occurred at a faster rate than in any other treatment group. These results indicate that at low to moderate water temperatures, extended air exposure for bluegill may result in little mortality. However, at high water temperatures, short-term mortality (within 48 h) can be substantial, especially for fish that experience extended air exposure durations. Anglers and managers must recognize that C{\&}R stressors can interact to have more dire consequences than when applied independently. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Landing nets used by recreational anglers can be constructed of a variety of different mesh materials. Anglers and fisheries managers have hypothesized that mesh type may affect injury rates and fish survival. To test this hypothesis, we used bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) as a model species to examine the effects of different net mesh types (rubber, knotless nylon, fine knotted nylon, coarse knotted nylon) on injury and mortality following angling at 26 °C. A control group consisted of individuals that were angled and held out of the water but not netted. Retention in a landing net for 30 s resulted in increased pectoral and caudal fin abrasion relative to control fish. Furthermore, evidence of dermal disturbance (i.e. scale and/or mucous loss) was more prevalent in netted fish than in control individuals. No control fish died during a 168 h holding period, whereas mortality rates ranged from 4 to 14{\%} for fish landed with nets, and the majority of mortality occurred between 48 and 96 h post-treatment. Fish that died exhibited impaired swimming behavior for approximately 24 h prior to death that was attributable to the extreme caudal fin erosion. Fish that died also had Saprolegnian lesions on the caudal peduncle that had begun to progress anteriorly toward the gills. Our results indicate that fish captured and landed by hand had lower injury rates than those fish landed using a net and experienced no mortality. Conversely, all net types resulted in heightened injury and mortality with the knotted mesh types being more injurious than the rubber or knotless mesh. This study supports the hypotheses that landing nets injure fish, and that mesh type alters the severity of injury. We urge further study using larger species of fish that are commonly landed using these gear types. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Condition assessment is commonly practiced by fisheries personnel as one tool for evaluating fish populations and communities. Several noninvasive condition measures are available for use, including Fulton's condition factor (K), relative condition factor (Kn), and relative weight (Wr). The use of Wr as a condition measure has increased within several peer-reviewed journals. In 1995 to 1996, survey responses from agency personnel in 48 states indicated that 22 states used Wr as a standard technique, 18 states identified Wr use as occasional, whereas only eight states indicated no Wr use. The regression-line-percentile technique is recommended for developing standard weight (Ws) equations. There are currently Ws equations available for 52 species and three purposeful hybrids. Length-related trends in condition need to be evaluated prior to calculating a population mean Wr. Relative weight target ranges should be adjusted to meet specific management objectives. Relative weight values are influenced by seasonal dynamics. The uses of Wr may go beyond just a measure of fish "plumpness." Relative weight can serve as a surrogate for estimating fish body composition, as a measure of fish health, and to assess prey abundance, fish stockings, and management actions.},

A symposium on Muskellunge and Northern Pike biology, ecology and management was held at the American Fisheries Society Annual Meeting in Little Rock, Arkansas, and a panel discussion following the symposium identified several research and management priorities, including spawning habitat identification, habitat and population restoration, genetics, and selective mortality and exploitation. Future Muskellunge and Northern Pike research should focus on quantifying egg and age-0 survival based on habitat characteristics, rigorously evaluating habitat restoration efforts using statistically sound study designs, describing range-wide genetic structure of populations, and developing a better understanding of how selective mortality and exploitation can alter population size structure, sex ratios, and life history characteristics. Information and outcomes from the proposed research and management priorities will be critical for conserving and restoring self-sustaining populations of Muskellunge and Northern Pike.},

abstract = {Most (84{\%}) of Ohio's remaining Lake Erie wetlands are diked to maximize food production and habitat for migrating waterfowl. Typically these wetlands are partially drained during spring and refilled the following fall. Fish populations have not been managed extensively, probably because few quantitative data are available on fish communities in diked wetlands and on how water-level manipulations affect these communities. We used trap nets to sample fish monthly (April-August) in diked West Marsh and in the formerly diked Muddy Creek Bay. We compared fish communities on the basis of species richness, composition, and equitability; relative abundance; and mean length and body condition of species common to both areas. We collected 23 species from the diked area and 40 species from the undiked area. Although there were more species collected in the undiked area, species equitability was greater in the diked wetland. The five most abundant species in the diked wetland were white crappie Poinoxis annularis, brown bullhead Amieurus nebulosus, black bullhead A. melas, goldfish Carassius entratus, and common carp Cyprinis carpio. The dominant species in the undiked area were white perch Morone americana, gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum, white crappie, brown bullhead, and yellow perch Perca flavescens. Neither area contained a classical, diverse wetland fish community. Mean lengths of white crappie, common carp, goldfish, and brown bullhead were significantly greater from the undiked area during all months. Body condition indices of {\textgreater} 150 mm white crappies and {\textgreater} 225 mm brown bullheads were significantly greater in the undiked area after June. The large differences in length and condition indices indicate that fish communities in the diked wetland may be biologically isolated from those in the adjacent undiked area. This has management implications given that an almost complete exchange of water occurs annually and could result in extensive movement of fish in and out of the diked wetland. Management strategies compatible with or enhancing existing wildlife management strategies need to be developed for improving fish communities in diked wetlands and enhancing their contribution to Lake Erie.},

Continental-scale acoustic telemetry networks are increasingly being established worldwide, producing large volumes of information-rich geospatial data.

Simultaneously, IMOS developed a centralised national database to foster collaborative research across the user community and quantify individual behaviour across a broad range of taxa. Here we present the database and quality control procedures developed to collate 49.6 million valid detections from 1891 receiving stations. This dataset consists of detections for 3,777 tags deployed on 117 marine species, with distances travelled ranging from a few to thousands of kilometres. Connectivity between regions was only made possible by the joint contribution of IMOS infrastructure and researcher-funded receivers. This dataset constitutes a valuable resource facilitating meta-analysis of animal movement, distributions, and habitat use, and is important for relating species distribution shifts with environmental covariates.},

abstract = {Summary: Tricaine methane-sulfonate (MS-222) is one of the most widely used anaesthetics for poikilotherms worldwide. This paper outlines its anaesthetic efficacy and dosage in fish and legislation for its use, fish stress responses to MS-222 anaesthesia and its effect on fish physiology and blood properties, pharmacokinetics, genotoxicity, immune response, potential interference with fish hepatic cytochrome P450 spectra, and its impact on nerve sensitivity. Key questions arising from the available data are analysed, such as regulatory constraints on its use, the need for the standardization of buffering protocols, and interdependencies of the factors impacting the specific applicative efficacy of MS-222. Current research has provided an abundance of data on MS-222 use in fish, although the applications within these studies are often impractical at the farming level. Specific emphasis is therefore placed on highlighting application strategies on a practical basis, presenting potential future research on topics that require in-depth analysis (preparation and storage of anaesthetic solutions, pre-anaesthetic sedation and stress reduction, cortisol response in aquarium fish, toxicity of MS-222 metabolites, and possible immunodepressive properties). Additionally, both from a scientific and practical perspective, it is necessary to have a better understanding of safety margins, induction, immersion and recovery times for many (marine and freshwater, farmed and ornamental) fish species in order to achieve optimal utilization. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Verlag, Berlin.},

abstract = {The behavior of anglers targeting Muskellunge Esox masquinongy in Wisconsin has changed over time from being harvest oriented to catch-and-release oriented. Our objectives were to use the long-term tagging data set (1956–2016) available on the Muskellunge population of Escanaba Lake, Wisconsin, to characterize sex-specific age structure, length at age, and survival in relation to a potential change in angler harvest. We hypothesized that (1) angler harvest has changed over time, (2) age structure and length at age have changed in relation to the change in angler harvest, and (3) annual survival has changed over time in relation to changes in angler harvest. A breakpoint analysis revealed distinct changes in angler total harvest over time, occurring in 1995 and 2011. Muskellunge harvest (1956–1994) was significantly higher (29.7 ± 15.9 fish/year [mean ± SD]) than that observed during 1995–2010 (6.5 ± 2.9 fish/year) and 2011–2016 (0.83 ± 1.1 fish/year). Sex-specific growth did not differ between fishery type (i.e., high and low harvest). However, there was evidence that the asymptotic length of female Muskellunge was higher during the high harvest fishery. The top model in program MARK suggested that survival (S) differed by fishery type; i.e., S high  ± SD = 0.72 ± 0.01 and S low  ± SD = 0.99 ± 0.006. Exploitation was the primary component of annual mortality. Natural and discard mortality could not be differentiated. Natural and discard mortality was 9.2 ± 11{\%}/year during the high harvest fishery and 4.9 ± 5.9{\%}/year during the low harvest fishery. Reductions in Muskellunge exploitation led to increased survival and no apparent change in length at age. These results from Escanaba Lake suggest that the lack of harvest leading to an unexploited Muskellunge fishery may result in population stability, improved age structure distribution, and adult survival, but could potentially hinder management actions meant to further increase population density or growth potential to trophy size.},

Finally, we explore applications of the model to Bergmann's rule, predicting the mouse-to-elephant curve, climate-disease-toxicant interactions, animal 'design' via genetic engineering and energetic constraints on community structure. As a first test of the model we present calculations and metabolic chamber measurements for mammals ranging in size from mice to Holstein calves. We then compare simultaneous measurements on deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus, of oxygen consumption, doubly labelled water turnover and food consumption with calculations of metabolic rate using body temperature radio-telemetry as input to the endotherm model. The endotherm model derived in the Appendix requires data on allometry (body dimensions, surface area), fur properties, core temperature, air and radiant temperatures and wind speed. The model is useful for calculating energetic expenditure in different microclimates without the need for extensive physiological measurements in the laboratory. Model predictions of metabolic rate at 12-degrees-C and at 22-degrees-C were well correlated with each of the three empirical estimates. The model shows that the posture an animal assumes can influence measurements of metabolic rate. Model calculations of metabolic rate using postures ranging from a curled-up ball-like geometry to a sprawled-out, cylinder or ellipsoid geometry bracket all three sets of simultaneous empirical data taken on the same animals. Applications of the model show that it can be applied in a wide variety of circumstances to gain insight into physiological and ecological problems.},

abstract = {Master of Science in Biology Radio telemetry was used to determine the seasonal distribution and thermal preferences of muskellunge (Esox masquinongy) in Melton Hill Lake, a mainstem reservoir on the Clinch River in east Tennessee. Muskellunge have been stocked into Melton Hill Lake since 1998, creating a popular sport fishery on the southern edge of this species' native range. Unlike many reservoirs, Melton Hill Lake offers a thermally heterogeneous environment resulting from cold hypolimnetic discharges from an upstream dam and warmwater discharged from a coal-fired electric generation plant. Due to the wide range of water temperatures with suitable dissolved oxygen throughout much of the year, Melton Hill Lake differs from other systems in which muskellunge have been studied using biotelemetry. Adult muskellunge (n = 30) with internal temperature-sensing radio tags were tracked biweekly from March 2010 to March 2011. Maps of monthly and seasonal fish distributions were created using 50{\%} and 95{\%} kernel density estimates with ArcGIS software. Seasonal differences in temperature selection, depth, and distance to the nearest shore were tested using mixed-model ANOVA. Fish in summer and early fall were widely distributed between the steam plant and Melton Hill Dam. In the spring, late fall, and winter they tended to occupy a small reach downstream of the stream plant. Tagged fish occupied shallow, inshore water during spring, fall, and winter, and deeper, offshore water during summer. Mean tag temperatures varied among seasons and were highest in summer, intermediate in spring and fall, and lowest in winter. When the greatest range in water temperatures was available (summer 2010; 7.1-33.3 C), tagged fish selected water between 20 to 25°C. During winter, they aggregated in the warmest water available at the thermal plume discharged from the steam plant. The abundance and composition of forage fish was sampled seasonally to assess the possible role of forage availability on the distribution of tagged muskellunge. Although catch rates of potential forage fish species varied, suitable forage appeared to be available throughout the reservoir in all seasons and the abundance (or lack thereof) of forage did not appear to influence habitat or temperature selection.},

abstract = {Locomotor kinematics of tiger musky (Esox sp.) and rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) were measured at 'steady' swimming speeds of up to 85 cm s" 1. Tail beat frequencies of musky were approximately 2 Hz higher than those of trout at any swimming speed, but tail beat amplitudes were 0-04L (where L is total body length) smaller. The product of these two variables was similar for the two species at any speed. The length of the propulsive wave was independent of speed, and was 0-8L for musky, somewhat smaller than the value for trout, 0-9L. The depth of the caudal fin trailing edge of trout was greater than that of musky, but the greater depth of the posteriorly located median fins of musky also contributed to thrust production. The cosine of the angle of the trailing edge to its beat plane showed the same phase relationship with lateral displacement in both musky and trout. It increased with speed for both species, and values for musky were slightly smaller. Thrust power requirements of musky and trout were similar. Thrust (= drag) coefficients of musky were 1-55 times larger than those for trout: this is roughly as expected on the basis of the larger proportion of the total area of musky located caudally and the higher drag coefficients in this region of the body. Lateral recoil movements of musky were unexpectedly smaller than for trout and were associated with smaller energy wastage from undamped recoil movements. The large recoil expected for the body form of musky was damped to some extent by higher tail beat frequencies, although this entailed some loss in Froude efficiency. Otherwise, no hydrodynamic explanation for the small recoil movements of musky was apparent. It is suggested that the myotomal muscles could be involved in minimizing recoil. The esociform morphology incurs costs in steady swimming, in comparison with generalist cruises, because of reduced sprint speeds for fish of a given length or increased power requirements for fish of a given mass.},

abstract = {Although many fish are captured and released following hook removal by recreational anglers, some fish break the line and are confronted by the potential impediment of a lure lodged in the jaw, buccal cavity, or throat. We simulated break-off events by releasing northern pike (Esox lucius) into Lake Opinicon, Canada with custom-built lures that were manufactured to contain radio transmitters. Treatment groups combined hook placements (lower jaw, upper and lower jaw, throat) and hook types (barbed and barbless) to investigate the effects on pike survival, movement, and lure shedding. Fifty-one pike were released (522 ± 64 mm), three of which died (6{\%}; 95{\%} CI = 2–16{\%}). Data were analysed by dummy variable regression to investigate the main effects of hook placements and hook type in pike. Cumulative distance swam after release was significantly reduced by deep hooking and lower jaw hooking. All fish except for one shed the lures within 14 d of release, and barbed hooks and lures lodged in the lower jaw significantly increased the time required for pike to shed lures. In light with previous work, we documented significant short-term behavioural consequences of lure break-off for pike (i.e. hyperactivity) but the experimental fish rapidly and naturally shed the hooks within days in nearly every instance. Given our findings, for pike (and likely related species such as muskellunge), anglers can be reasonably confident that long-term damage to individuals is limited even when a lure is retained by an animal following a break off event. Nonetheless, use of barbless hooks facilitates lure shedding, and all efforts should be taken to avoid break off events in the first instance using appropriate gear (e.g., wire leader, heavy line) especially when angling for fish with sharp dentition.},

abstract = {Understanding predator–prey interactions is critical for marine fisheries and ecosystem management as they shape community structure, regulate prey populations and present energy demands critical for community sustainability. We examined multispecies functional responses of 17 fishes (48 predator-size combinations) spanning piscivores, planktivores and benthivores for the northeast US continental shelf. Similar to previous work, linear relationships between predation and prey density (Holling type I response) were not supported, since model estimates of handling time were greater than zero for the prey considered. Instead, a clear majority of the predators sampled were Holling type III feeders (sigmoidal; prey switching or learning). For piscivores, nearly all responses were Holling type III with the exception of one being Holling type II (hyperbolic; satiation). Planktivores and benthivores exhibited a combination of type IV (feeding confusion at high prey density) and Holling type III responses. The relationships were predator- and prey-dependent, which is counter to assumptions that are often made of trophic groups. Decreased predation at high prey densities (type IV response) present among planktivores and benthivores suggests an overestimation of predation can occur if ignored. This contrasts with fish and squid prey which primarily invoked a Holling type III response. Functional responses are key to modelling trophic interactions for multispecies and ecosystem models. By refining these inputs in a multispecies context with empirical data, we can advance our understanding of whole-shelf ecology and improve decision-making tools for resource management.},

Water and ﬁn ray Sr:Ca were strongly correlated. Six lakes in Illinois possessed Sr:Ca signatures that were distinct from the hatchery where muskellunge were raised, resulting in pronounced shifts in Sr:Ca across sectioned ﬁn rays of stocked ﬁsh. Hatchery and lake-speciﬁc Sr:Ca signatures were stable across years. Sixteen of 19 individual ﬁsh known to have been stocked based on PIT tags implanted at stocking were correctly identiﬁed as hatchery-origin ﬁsh using ﬁn ray core Sr:Ca. Results also indicated that the hatchery Sr:Ca signal can be retained for at least 7 years in ﬁn rays of stocked ﬁsh.

@article{WendelaarBonga1997,
abstract = {The stress response in teleost fish shows many similarities to that of the terrestrial vertebrates. These concern the principal messengers of the brain-sympathetic-chromaffin cell axis (equivalent of the brain-sympathetic- adrenal medulla axis) and the brain-pituitary-interrenal axis (equivalent of the brain-pituitary-adrenal axis), as well as their functions, involving stimulation of oxygen uptake and transfer, mobilization of energy substrates, reallocation of energy away from growth and reproduction, and mainly suppressive effects on immune functions. There is also growing evidence for intensive interaction between the neuroendocrine system and the immune system in fish. Conspicuous differences, however, are present, and these are primarily related to the aquatic environment of fishes. For example, stressors increase the permeability of the surface epithelia, including the gills, to water and ions, and thus induce systemic hydromineral disturbances. High circulating catecholamine levels as well as structural damage to the gills and perhaps the skin are prime causal factors. This is associated with increased cellular turnover in these organs. In fish, cortisol combines glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid actions, with the latter being essential for the restoration of hydromineral homeostasis, in concert with hormones such as prolactin (in freshwater) and growth hormone (in seawater). Toxic stressors are part of the stress literature in fish more so than in mammals. This is mainly related to the fact that fish are exposed to aquatic pollutants via the extensive and delicate respiratory surface of the gills and, in seawater, also via drinking. The high bioavailability of many chemicals in water is an additional factor. Together with the variety of highly sensitive perceptive mechanisms in the integument, this may explain why so many pollutants evoke an integrated stress response in fish in addition to their toxic effects at the cell and tissue levels. Exposure to chemicals may also directly compromise the stress response by interfering with specific neuroendocrine control mechanisms. Because hydromineral disturbance is inherent to stress in fish, external factors such as water pH, mineral composition, and ionic calcium levels have a significant impact on stressor intensity. Although the species studied comprise a small and nonrepresentative sample of the almost 20, 000 known teleost species, there are many indications that the stress response is variable and flexible in fish, in line with the great diversity of adaptations that enable these animals to live in a large variety of aquatic habitats.},

The agents were tested individually and as combination anaesthesia comprising pre-anaesthetic sedation with a low dosage of metomidate or 2-phenoxyethanol followed by anaesthesia with benzocaine or MS-222. All agents were administered through bath immersion with an exposure time of 5 min. The different treatments resulted in average induction and recovery times ranging from 52 ± 6 s to 182 ± 16 s and 77 ± 26 s to 659 ± 46 s respectively. Induction and recovery times varied in relation to water temperature and were generally shorter at 16 °C for all weight groups and treatments compared to 8 °C. For benzocaine and MS-222 induction and recovery times were found to increase with increasing body weight. For metomidate the recovery time increased with increasing weight whereas there were no weight related differences in induction time. No differences in either induction or recovery times associated to body weight were found for 2-phenoxyethanol. Acute stress prior to anaesthesia with MS-222 resulted in significantly shorter induction time and prolonged recovery time, as well as deeper anaesthetised fish. The dosage of MS-222 had to be reduced in order to avoid mortality in fish subjected to acute stress. Combination anaesthesia allowed a reduction of the dosages used for inducing anaesthesia and produced markedly reduced recovery times compared to agents administered individually. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Juvenile largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, intraperitoneally implanted with microradio transmitters exhibited short-term (5 days) inflammation around the incision and suture insertion points for both non-absorbable braided silk and non-absorbable polypropylene monofilament, but in the longer term (20 days) almost all sutures were shed and the incisions were completely healed. Cumulative mortality was higher for fish with braided silk sutures, however, post-mortem analysis revealed that violations to the gastro-intestinal tract from the surgical procedure were the usual cause of the mortality. Mortality was generally low in control fish. The two surgeons who performed the implantations differed substantially in experience. Despite receiving basic training, the novice surgeon took longer to complete the surgeries, had reduced suture precision and experienced more fish mortality relative to the experienced surgeon. For both surgeons, it took longer to complete suturing with polypropylene than with braided silk. During the surgery day, the experienced surgeon exhibited consistently rapid surgery times, whereas the novice surgeon exhibited significantly improved speed as the number of surgeries completed increased. This study suggests that microtransmitters can be successfully implanted in juvenile largemouth bass but some mortality can be expected. This mortality seems to be independent of suture material, but dependent upon the experience of the surgeon. {\textcopyright} 2003 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.},

abstract = {Space use and diets of sympatric bobcats Lynx rufus and pumas Puma concolor were compared using sign surveys and scat analysis during 1997–2002 in southeastern Arizona, USA. Bobcats appeared to use grassland, scrub, riparian and woodland habitats equally, but pumas had higher activity in riparian and woodland habitats. There was little evidence that bobcats avoided pumas in space use. Bobcats ate primarily rodents (33{\%} of items in scats), lagomorphs (32{\%}) and ungulates (16{\%}), whereas pumas ate primarily ungulates (69{\%}) and carnivores (21{\%}). Pumas had a narrower dietary niche breadth than bobcats, and puma diet overlapped bobcat diet by 56{\%}, suggesting that pumas may be more vulnerable to changes in prey density than bobcats. Pumas also killed and consumed bobcats, indicating that interference competition may be manifesting through intraguild predation},

abstract = {Age and growth data extracted from scales are often used when managing fish populations. However, accurate interpretation of scale annuli in certain species, such as muskellunge Esox masquinongy, has been suspect. The accuracy of age determination was tested with three experienced esocid scale readers who interpreted positive photo images made from acetate slide impressions projected on a microfiche reader. Images were made from scales of 25 known-age muskellunge (3-10 years old) from five Wisconsin lakes. Each scale image was interpreted twice; once with fish length, sex, and date of capture given and once without any information. Of 149 scale interpretations. 32{\%} were assessed with the correct age. 54{\%} underaged. and 14{\%} overaged. The average interpretation deviated from the known age by 1.0 years. Accuracy did not improve when additional fish information was available. General confidence in the interpreter's age assessments was low and possibly related to quality of the photo images. Interpreters were accustomed to using acetate images with several impressions rather than a single photo image. As a follow-up, we selected 12 acetate slides used to make the photo images and allowed each interpreter to determine age from the slides. The percentage correctly aged with the subsample improved from 24{\%} to 47{\%} with the acetate slide impressions. Increasing the magnification of acetate slides from 23 x to 35 x magnification did not affect accuracy. Image quality and multiple impressions can improve accuracy of age determination; however, accuracy was still less than 50{\%}. The low accuracy when interpreting scale annuli of muskellunge 3-10 years of age suggests that managers need to use caution when evaluating data taken from muskellunge scales.},

abstract = {Telemetry is an increasingly common tool for studying the ecology of wild fish, with great potential to provide valuable information for management and conservation. For researchers to conduct a robust telemetry study, many essential considerations exist related to selecting the appropriate tag type, fish capture and tagging methods, tracking protocol, data processing and analyses, and interpretation of findings. For telemetry-derived knowledge to be relevant to managers and policy makers, the research approach must consider management information needs for decision-making, while end users require an understanding of telemetry technology (capabilities and limitations), its application to fisheries research and monitoring (study design), and proper interpretation of results and conclusions (considering the potential for biases and proper recognition of associated uncertainties). To help bridge this gap, we provide a set of considerations and a checklist for researchers to guide them in conducting reliable and management-relevant telemetry studies, and for managers to evaluate the reliability and relevance of telemetry studies so as to better integrate findings into management plans. These considerations include implicit assumptions, technical limitations, ethical and biological realities, analytical merits, and the relevance of study findings to decision-making processes.},

abstract = {—Three hundred fifty juvenile rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, reared under captive conditions, were exposed to 300-V continuous DC or low-frequency (30-Hz) pulsed DC (PDC) for one or three electroshocking passes to evaluate the effects of electroshock on mortality, injury, and growth over 147 d. Mortality was negligible (ϳ1{\%}) in all treatments. Injury rates varied from 15{\%} to 39{\%}, with PDC causing a greater number (but typically less severe) injuries than analogous DC sampling. Multiple-pass sampling designs caused more spinal injuries than single-pass designs. Longer (heavier) fish sustained more spinal injuries. Electroshocking reduced mean growth rates, but there were no statistically significant differences in growth between treatment groups. Growth in length was significantly reduced with increasing severity of injuries. Thus, it appears that growth was not directly impaired by electroshocking but rather by the occurrence of spinal injury, the severity of which was directly proportional to the magnitude of the growth depression. Extrapo-lation of the experimental data to field studies in which 20{\%} or less of the population is sampled suggested reductions of 3{\%} or less in mean population growth with DC or low-frequency PDC electroshocking.},

abstract = {Catch-and-release angling is an increasingly popular conservation strategy employed by anglers voluntarily or to comply with management regulations, but associated injuries, stress and behavioural impairment can cause post-release mortality or fitness impairments. Because the fate of released fish is primarily determined by angler behaviour, employing ‘best angling practices' is critical for sustainable recreational fisheries. While basic tenants of best practices are well established, anglers employ a diversity of tactics for a range of fish species, thus it is important to balance science-based best practices with the realities of dynamic angler behaviour. Here we describe how certain tools and tactics can be integrated into recreational fishing practices to marry best angling practices with the realities of angling. While the effects of angling practices vary considerably across contexts and conditions, we also outline available methods for assessing fish condition by examining physical injuries and reflexes, which enable recreational anglers to make educated real-time decisions related to angling practices, as well as when, where, and whether to release captured fish based on their probability of survival. In cases where fish are in poor condition, there are recovery tactics available that can improve survival, although this is among the most understudied aspects of angling practices.},

abstract = {The American Fisheries Society, the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists, and the American Institute of Fishery Research Biologists are professional societies that are focused on scientific understanding and conservation of fish and fisheries. These professional organizations are associations of scientists and resource managers whose primary interests are fish and fisheries. Their policies and position statements are based primarily on information that has been developed through scientific processes, but they also reflect ethical concerns, including the conservation of the diversity and number of fishes and respect for life and life processes in all forms. Research investigations of fishes, the environments in which fishes are found, the factors influencing the health and well-being of fishes, and the variety of human activities that depend upon and/or affect fishes are core activities for all three societies. These societies, however, believe that their members are responsible not only for advancing scientific knowledge and understanding of fish and fisheries but for improving human appreciation for these animals and the industries that they support. All three societies actively promote research and the dissemination of information derived from that research. They also advocate respect for life processes, the forms of life that make up the various ecosystems, and the humane treatment of animals used in research investigation. The understanding and welfare of animals used in research can be served best by using a multidisciplinary approach in which data and expertise from several scientific disciplines, including such areas as ecology, behavior, nutrition, genetics, physiology, anatomy, and fish health, are merged in order to address issues concerning animal care and use. At the same time, it must be understood that research is conducted in a variety of human culture settings. Ideally, scientific procedures, methods of analyses, interpretations of statistically valid data, and conclusions based on scientific studies should be consistent across all cultures, even though personal belief systems can and do influence concepts as to what practices and methods are, or are not, consistent with humane treatment of animals. The members of the Uses of Fishes in Research (UFR) Committee who developed the new and revised Guidelines for the Use of Fishes in Research (referred to as Guidelines in this document) are scientists, and each member carries a deep respect for life processes and the myriad forms of life. The Guidelines that follow reflect not only the scientific expertise of the UFR Committee members but also express the desire of the committee members to promote scientifically valid research on fish and fish habitats, research that is conducted in a manner acceptable to the societies within which the research takes place and to the benefit of the fishes and the ecosystems in which they live. The new Guidelines have been developed to replace the Guidelines for the Use of Fishes in Field Research (ASIH et al. 1987, 1988) and to expand the coverage to include laboratory research. The new Guidelines include listings of web sites that should be of value; however, readers are cautioned to check such sites frequently because their content or addresses may change. If readers experience difficulty in reaching a specific site, they are advised to access the general site and then search for specific references.},

abstract = {A change in the use of spawning habitats linked with water-level management may explain differences in reproductive success among sympatric St. Lawrence River northern pike Esox lucius and muskellunge Esox masquinongy. Reproductive success in a shared spawning and nursery bay was compared based on egg (embryo) and age-0 abundance estimates before the fall emigration of young. Historically, northern pike were noted to commence spawning runs in shallow flooded areas soon after ice-out. I found that more than 87{\%} of the estimated northern pike egg deposition in 1994 occurred in offshore, deep-water habitats (2–5 m) and that 99{\%} did in 1995. Northern pike began spawning 17 d before muskellunge in 1994 and 31 d earlier in 1995. Spawning peaks occurred during the interval of 16–23 May. Muskellunge mostly spawned near shore ({\textless}1.5-m depth) in submerged aquatic vegetation growth that was absent during northern pike spawning. Muskellunge spawning began and peaked between 23 May and 4 June in 1994 and between 23 May and 1 June in 1995. Estimated egg deposition by northern pike was over 40 times that of muskellunge for the 2 years combined. Despite greater egg deposition, minimum survival estimates of northern pike from egg to fall juvenile were very low: 0.00008{\%} in 1994 and 0.00010{\%} in 1995. By comparison, minimum muskellunge survival estimates (egg to fall juvenile) were greater: 0.034{\%} in 1994 and 0.105{\%} in 1995. In seine surveys age-0 muskellunge catch per unit effort was negatively correlated with that of northern pike (r = −0.77), and muskellunge dominated catches for 9 of 10 years sampled. Growth of inshore submergent habitat during muskellunge spawning and the low abundance of northern pike may have contributed to the greater reproductive success of muskellunge.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n},

abstract = {Fish stress and mortality can be significant problems in both capture and culture operations. In addition to inexpensive and real-time metrics, ones that are simple to use are also desirable for measuring fish stress and predicting mortality. Current methods to define stress rely on expensive, laboratory-based measurements of changes in fish pathology such as disease, necropsy and histology, in physiology such as plasma cortisol, lactate, glucose and ions and in complex behaviour determined from swimming, feeding and predator evasion. All of these methods are often not rigorously linked to fitness outcomes. An alternative is to observe reflex impairment as a direct sign of stress which can be easily and rapidly measured in free swimming or restrained fish responding to peripheral stimuli such as gravity, light, sound and touch. Reflex impairment is correlated with stress and mortality outcomes, eliminating the need for prolonged holding or monitoring of fish. A few examples of reflexes that may be impaired include orientation, startle responses, fin erection, body flex upon restraint, operculum and mouth clamping or gaping, gag response and vestibular-ocular response. Reflex impairment combines the effects of stressors and their interactions and is not dependent on fish size, motivation states and acclimation which make it a consistent sign of stress across a wide range of stressor types and fish ages. Use of reflex impairment to measure stress and predict mortality would significantly improve monitoring of fish health and welfare in many types of field operations such as commercial and recreational fishing, aquaculture, live transport, stock enhancement and tagging.

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of alternating current (a.c.) stunning on brain activity in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Electroencephalogaphy (EEG) was used to determine loss and return of consciousness following stunning. Three groups of salmon were stunned in seawater using 50 Hz sinusoidal a.c., with field strengths equal to 200, 50 and 25 V/m at current durations 1, 3 and 12 s. After stunning, visual evoked responses (VERs) were measured by EEG of the optic tectum. Results showed that all electrically stunned fish lost VERs, and that time to recovery of VERs was dependent on the combination of current duration and electric field strength. Hence, high voltage stunning, using 200 V/m in 1 s resulted in a mean recovery time of VERs equal to 154 s, while low voltage stunning at 50-25 V/m in 3 and 12 s, the time to recovery was 288 and 212 s, respectively. These results show that electrical stunning can cause immediate loss of consciousness in fish, and can be applied as a stunning method prior to slaughter. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Fin rays and spines are becoming more popular for age and growth analysis. A protocol for processing structures is first to mount the structure in epoxy, then to use a low-speed saw or handsaw to section the structure, and finally to estimate age from the resulting section. Unfortunately, scientists are often unaware of efficient techniques for mounting structures for such analyses. We describe a simple technique for mounting fin rays and spines in epoxy in preparation for sectioning. The advantages of this method include minimal preparation time, low cost, and little or no damage to hard structures. We have used this technique extensively to estimate age from the fin rays and spines of shovelnose sturgeon Scaphirhynchus platorynchus, catosto- mids, cyprinids, and ictalurids; however, this technique is useful for any species for which fin rays or spines are used in age and growth analyses. In addition, the technique is not limited to fin rays and spines; it can also be used to prepare a variety of other structures, such as scutes, otoliths, and brachiostegal rays.},

abstract = {Fisheries professionals charged with managing muskellunge Esox masquinongy frequently seek population information that requires the ability to identify cohorts as well as individuals; hence, reliable tagging methods are needed. Our approach was to simultaneously assess multiple marking techniques on different life stages of muskellunge over short and long time scales. We evaluated the short-term detection of visible implant elastomer (VIE) and passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags in muskellunge fingerlings in experimental ponds. We compared survival (relative to that of control fish) and tag retention for two PIT tagging locations (the cheek and dorsal musculature) and one VIE location (the jaw). Overwinter survival did not differ between tagged and untagged fish (84–98{\%}), but overwinter PIT tag retention was lower for the cheek (92{\%}) than the dorsal musculature (100{\%}). We also fin-clipped and VIE-tagged (jaw) 1,651 muskellunge fingerlings from 1997 to 2002 to evaluate long-term tag retention in a broodstock lake. In addition, 125 adult muskellunge were captured and PIT-tagged from 2003 to 2006. Muskellunge were sampled annually with trap nets and electrofishing during spring and fall. Only 2 VIE tags were detected in adults marked as fingerlings. The proportion of PIT-tagged adults recaptured ranged from 52{\%} to 84{\%} during the sampling period. Our results indicate that both VIE and PIT tags are viable short-term marks for muskellunge fingerlings, while PIT tags appear to be reliable long-term tags when implanted in the dorsal musculature of adults. {\textcopyright} 2010 Taylor  {\&}  Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Nearshore sites of the Great Lakes and their connecting channels provide critical nursery habitat for muskellunge (Esox masquinongy) and the fishes they prey upon. However, limited understanding of habitat-fish assemblage relations hinders informed management and restoration of these communities. To help fill this information gap, we (1) described fish assemblages at 25 sites in Buffalo Harbor (Lake Erie), the upper Niagara River, and the St. Lawrence River, (2) compared assemblages among sites and waters, and (3) determined if assemblage structure was related to habitat variation. The structure of fish assemblages at muskellunge nursery sites was influenced by suitability of habitats for particular reproductive strategies and providing refugia from predation. Sites that had flowing water, coarse substrates, high macrophyte column density, and little or no macroalgae supported greater fish densities and more species-rich assemblages that were dominated by small-bodied, fusiform cyprinids. These complex habitats provided refugia from predation and were suitable for open substratum spawners. Shallow sites with negligible stream flow, fine substrates, low macrophyte column density, and greater macroalgae coverage contained small-bodied, fusiform fishes; deeper sites with similar habitat were dominated by larger-bodied, laterally-compressed centrarchids and yellow perch (Perca flavescens), whose reproductive strategies and anti-predator adaptations allow them to persist in such habitats. Small-bodied, fusiform fishes such as banded killifish (Fundulus diaphanus), cyprinids, and darters are important prey for young-of-the-year muskellunge, whereas laterally-compressed centrarchids and yellow perch are typically avoided. Managing for habitats that support abundant fusiform fishes should provide better nursery conditions and promote stronger year-class formation for muskellunge. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The functional response is the relationship between the feeding rate of an animal and its food density. It is reliant on two basic parameters; the volume searched for prey per unit time (searching rate) and the time taken to consume each prey item (handling time). As fish functional responses can be difficult to determine directly, it may be more feasible to measure their underlying behavioural parameters in controlled conditions and use these to predict the functional response. Here, we tested how accurately a Type II functional response model predicted the observed functional response of roach Rutilus rutilus, a visually foraging fish, and compared it with Type I functional response. Foraging experiments were performed by exposing fish in tank aquaria to a range of food densities, with their response captured using a two-camera videography system. This system was validated and was able to accurately measure fish behaviour in the aquaria, and enabled estimates of fish reaction distance, swimming speed (from which searching rate was calculated) and handling time to be measured. The parameterised Type II functional response model accurately predicted the observed functional response and was superior to the Type I model. These outputs suggest it will be possible to accurately measure behavioural parameters in other animal species and use these to predict the functional response in situations where it cannot be observed directly. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

By use of radio-telemetry we compared different seasonal and diel temperature selection in a southern Illinois reservoir for three geographically and genetically distinct stocks of age-2 muskellunge from throughout the latitudinal range of the species. Muskellunge from the Upper Mississippi River drainage were represented by the Leech Lake, Minnesota, population and the Ohio River drainage was represented by the Cave Run Lake, Kentucky, population. Progeny from North Spring Lake, Illinois, an interstock, or mixed-origin stock, were also evaluated. No differences in temperature selection were observed among stocks of juvenile muskellunge across seasons or diel periods. The seasonal mean temperatures of the water varied significantly-spring 21.7°C, summer 28.4°C, and fall 14.8°C, with an overall average temperature of 24.1°C, in agreement with previously published values obtained in laboratory trials. This lack of different temperature-selection patterns among stocks is in contrast with other life-history characteristics, for example growth, metabolism, and conversion efficiency, which have been shown to differ among populations and stocks. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {—Many of Wisconsin's native populations of muskellunge Esox masquinongy exhibit declining reproductive success and failing natural recruitment. As a result, self-sustaining popu-lations of muskellunge are diminishing. This study focused on spawning habitat factors that in-fluence egg development and survival and, consequently, the reproductive success of muskellunge. Muskellunge spawning habitat characteristics in lakes with self-sustaining populations were com-pared with spawning habitat characteristics in lakes that were once self-sustaining but are now maintained by stocking. The hatching success of artificially fertilized eggs was assessed under natural lake conditions. Spawning sites were typically marshy areas in water less than 1 m deep. Characteristics of the spawning habitat influenced successful reproduction. Spawning areas in stocked lakes had low dissolved oxygen (DO; 1.2–5.4 mg/L) at the substrate–water interface, whereas self-sustaining lakes had more variable DO (0.5–9.6 mg/L) with some microhabitats having high DO. Organic carbon content, texture of spawning substrate, and water temperature at the substrate did not differ between self-sustaining lakes and lakes supported by stocking. Fallen logs, stumps, and other wood in spawning areas may increase egg survival. Muskellunge egg survival over natural substrate was low (0.0–1.3{\%}), even in lakes with self-sustaining populations. Col-lections of eggs and observations of fry indicated that major mortality occurred after egg deposition but before fry reached nursery habitats several weeks after hatching.},

abstract = {Most studies of injury associated with electrofishing have focused on salmonids: few have given attention to warmwater fishes. Under controlled laboratory conditions, we treated bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus, and largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides of various sizes to duty cycles ranging from 1.5{\%} to 100{\%}. This range of duty cycles represented continuous DC and pulsed-DC frequencies ranging from 15 to 110 Hz and pulse durations of 1 to 6 ms. At each duty cycle, fish were exposed to power densities in excess of those required to immobilize them within 3 s, and we subsequently determined the incidence of hemorrhage, spinal injury, and mortality. Incidence of hemorrhage averaged 3{\%} (range, 0-25{\%}), differed among species, and was not related to duty cycle or fish size. Incidence of spinal injury averaged 3{\%} (range, 0-22{\%}) and mortality averaged 10{\%} (range, 0-75{\%}); both differed among species and were related to duty cycle, fish size, and interactions among these variables. Largemouth bass was the species most vulnerable to hemorrhage, spinal injury, and mortality, channel catfish the least vulnerable; bluegills exhibited effects that were intermediate. Small centrarchids were especially susceptible to mortality. Fish tetanized by the electrical treatment were more likely to experience injury and mortality than fish that were only narcotized. However, mortality was not related to the injuries studied because hemorrhage and spinal injuries were similar in fish that survived electroshock and in those that died. We suggest that electrofishing with intermediate to high duty cycles could reduce electrofishing-induced injury and mortality to warmwater fish. Additionally, the power output and electrode system should be managed to induce narcosis and prevent tetany and to avoid the large peak powers required to immobilize small individuals.},

abstract = {For several fish species, increased river discharge has been linked to behavioral changes, including movement towards particular habitats. From 2000 to 2003, we used radiotelemetry to monitor habitat use by 42 muskellunge Esox masquinongy within a 17-km reach of the New River, Virginia; to evaluate habitat selection; and to determine whether habitat use and selection were affected by discharge. Water depth, occurrence of aquatic vegetation, substrate type, and distance to riverbanks within the study reach were mapped with hydroacoustic and Global Positioning System technologies. Real-time discharge measurements from an upstream U.S. Geological Survey stream gauge were used to classify fish locations into those made during periods of reduced ({\textless}75 m3/s) or increased ({\textgreater}75 m3/s) discharge. Seasonal habitat selection models for the different discharge levels were created using logistic regression. Differences in logistic regression coefficients between models were tested with multivariate chi-square tests and Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparisons. Meta-analytic averaging of Pearson's correlation coefficients was used to determine the overall effect size of discharge on habitat use by muskellunge. Overall, muskellunge exhibited a positive selection for deeper habitats; however, discharge was found to significantly affect both habitat use and selection. Habitat use was consistent with the hypothesis that fish moved to shallower habitats (both summer and winter) located closer to riverbanks (winter only) during periods of increased discharge. In terms of habitat selection, selection strengths for variables such as water depth (summer and winter) and distance to shoreline (winter only) generally weakened during periods of increased discharge, indicating that habitat use became more proportionate to availability. Increased movement as a result of increased discharge has been theorized to potentially reduce winter survival of fish because of seasonal energetic limitations. Thus, indirect effects on fish from dam operating modes (e.g., hydropeaking) may be as important as direct effects when evaluating biotic implications of water release schedules.},

To understand the contributions that various factors may have made to the trends in loads, earlier results of models linking loads to explanatory variables were combined with estimated trends in those variables. The study period was characterized by increases in temperature, wintertime precipitation and streamflow, conservation farming, and loads of nitrate and total suspended solids; decreases in snowfall and snow cover, fertilizer, manure from livestock, and loads of soluble reactive phosphorus; and relatively steady exports of total phosphorus. After removing the effects of trends in streamflow, nitrate loads increased much less while total suspended solids and total phosphorus loads declined. The analysis suggests that the nitrate increases were due largely to climatic factors, particularly increases in winter streamflow, decreases in snowfall and snow cover, and declining annual precipitation. Decreases in soluble reactive phosphorus were associated with changes in agricultural practices, particularly declines in fertilizer deliveries and head of livestock.},

In parallel, sophisticated tools have been developed to process, visualize and analyse tracking data; however, many of these tools have proliferated in isolation, making it challenging for users to select the most appropriate method for the question in hand. Indeed, within the r software alone, we listed 58 packages created to deal with tracking data or ‘tracking packages'. Here, we reviewed and described each tracking package based on a workflow centred around tracking data (i.e. spatio-temporal locations (x, y, t)), broken down into three stages: pre-processing, post-processing and analysis, the latter consisting of data visualization, track description, path reconstruction, behavioural pattern identification, space use characterization, trajectory simulation and others. Supporting documentation is key to render a package accessible for users. Based on a user survey, we reviewed the quality of packages' documentation and identified 11 packages with good or excellent documentation. Links between packages were assessed through a network graph analysis. Although a large group of packages showed some degree of connectivity (either depending on functions or suggesting the use of another tracking package), one third of the packages worked in isolation, reflecting a fragmentation in the r movement-ecology programming community. Finally, we provide recommendations for users when choosing packages, and for developers to maximize the usefulness of their contribution and strengthen the links within the programming community.},

abstract = {Concerns over the use of minimum-size regulations to increase the average weight of harvested striped bass Morone saxatilis in Tims Ford Reservoir, Tennessee, prompted this study of hooking mortality. To estimate mortality and examine behavior, striped bass longer than 508 mm total length were caught with conventional angling gear, tagged externally with ultrasonic transmitters equipped with ﬂoats, and released back into Tims Ford Reservoir. Over a 15-month period 89 ﬁsh were tagged and tracked for a minimum of 3 d. Mortality rates ranged from 14{\%} in November and December 1993 to 67{\%} in both August 1993 and July 1994. Although the confounding effects of tagging could not be separated from the effects of being hooked and released, disparate mortality rates among seasons, as well as observations of feeding and swimming behavior of tagged ﬁsh that survived, suggested that tagging effects were modest compared to hooking effects. Mortality rates were linearly related to air temperature (P ϭ 0.012) but not to landing time, handling time, bait type, ﬁsh total length, or water temperature. Characteristics that differed between striped bass that survived and those that did not were air temperature at capture (t-test; P ϭ 0.007) surface water temperature (t-test; P ϭ 0.081), and handling time (t-test; P ϭ 0.06). Nine striped bass were caught, tagged, and tracked intensively following release in late August 1994 to document their short-term behavior. All six ﬁsh that survived remained in warm surface waters for about 2 h following release before descending to the top of metalimnion. The three ﬁsh that died, surfaced within 1.5 h, from which we inferred that they were unable to regulate air bladder pressure. We concluded that a proposed year-round size limit of 610 mm total length would probably not improve the size structure of the population because of the high mortality of released ﬁsh that occurred during summer months.},

abstract = {The main objective of this study was to examine the relationship between leadership communication practices and organisational commitment among the staff in a selected institution of higher education. The chosen organisation is located in the Klang Valley and was established 37 years ago. Stratified random sampling was used for sample selection and a total of 235 respondents participated in this study using a questionnaire survey method. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-test, Pearson Product Moment correlation, and Multiple Regression using both enter and stepwise methods. With regard to the levels of organisational commitment, the study shows that the employee's affective, continuance and normative commitments are moderate. Correlation analysis showed significant relationships between leadership communication practices and organisational commitment. While communication climate tended to be a good predictor of organisational commitment. Through effective leadership communication practices, a leader is able to influence and convince employees to be more committed towards their organisation in order to achieve organisational objectives. In conclusion, this research shows that leadership communication practices can contribute towards higher staff commitment in an organisation. INTRODUCTION Leadership communication entails nurturing and maintaining a workplace environment in which communication flows freely and quickly in all directions (Mai and Akerson, 2003). Thus, leadership communication is one of the essential elements in management. Good communication in the workplace results in mutual understanding, harmony and action while poor communication only wastes time and resources, forestalls goal accomplishment and sours relationships. Communication is thus the key to effective leadership and without effective communication, a manager is not an effective leader (Barrett, 2006). Communication has been linked to organisational commitment in several ways. Allen (1992), for example, found that, especially in organisations involved in total quality management, communication variables explained up to 59 percent of the variance in organisational},

abstract = {We used radio telemetry to evaluate the movement and habitat use of paddlefish Polyodon spathula in the upper Mississippi River and two tributary rivers. Radio transmitters were surgically implanted into 71 paddlefish in Navigation Pools 5A and 8 of the upper Mississippi River, the Chippewa River, and the Wisconsin River during fall 1994 through fall 1996. Radiotagged paddlefish were located through summer 1997. The range of paddlefish movement was typically low during all seasons except spring, but some paddlefish moved throughout the 420-km extent of the study area. Paddlefish tagged in the Chippewa River were closely linked with the upper Mississippi River, as substantial portions of the population inhabited the adjacent Navigation Pool 4 each spring; paddlefish in the Wisconsin River, however, rarely ventured out of that tributary. The use of aquatic area types by paddlefish varied among the study reaches. A cartographic model of paddlefish habitat suitability was developed for Navigation Pool 8 based on geographic information systems (GIS) coverages of bathymetry and current velocity. The value of paddlefish habitat in the cartographic model increased with depth and decreased with current velocity. For example, areas modeled as excellent corresponded to regions classified as having both deep water (greater than or equal to6.0 m) and negligible ({\textless}5 cm/s) current velocities. Our study suggests that aquatic area types are an inadequate basis for making sound management decisions regarding the critical habitats of paddlefish in complex riverine systems because such strata rely on gross geomorpological features rather than on the physicochemical variables that fish use to choose habitats. The development of systemic GIS coverages of such variables could improve the understanding of fish habitat selection and management in the upper Mississippi River.},

abstract = {Coastal wetlands in the Laurentian Great Lakes are critical habitats for supporting fish diversity and abundance within the basin. Insight into the coupling of biodiversity patterns with habitat conditions may elucidate mechanisms shaping diverse communities. Within coastal wetlands, water depth as well as fluctuations in lake-wide water levels over inter-annual timescales, both have the potential to influence fish communities. Water level fluctuation can influence fish habitat structure (e.g., vegetation) in Great Lakes coastal wetlands, but it is unclear how water depth and lake-wide water level fluctuations affect fish community composition and diversity. Using $\beta$ dissimilarity indices and multivariate ordination techniques, we assessed fish community structure among bulrush (Schoenoplectus acutus)-dominated wetlands in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron, USA. We examined whether community structure was related to wetland water depth at the time of sampling and whether fish communities were more similar among years with similar Lake Huron water levels. Results suggested relatively high levels of both spatial (among wetlands) and temporal (among year) community dissimilarity that was driven primarily by species turnover. Thus, variability in water depths among wetlands and in Lake Huron water levels among years likely both contribute to regional fish diversity. Further, fish abundance and alpha diversity were positively correlated with wetland water depth at the time of sampling. Both climate change and anthropogenic water level stabilization may alter the magnitude and timing of water level fluctuations in the Great Lakes. Our data suggest that these changes could affect local fish community composition and regional fish diversity.},

abstract = {Fish are one of North America's most valuable renewable resources. Although recreational anglers harvest a portion of their catch, modern recreational fisheries are based on the principle of sustainable use, and most are highly regulated using the best available science, fisheries data and risk assessments. Recent surveys indicate that approximately 10–20{\%} of the North American population participates in angling, and the resulting economic impact is greater than that from commercial fishing and aquaculture; it even exceeds the combined annual revenue from several of the top major league sports in North America. The relationship between man and certain fish species that arises through activities such as recreational angling is an important driver of the science on aquatic species and their ecosystems. There are many other ways that recreational anglers contribute to conservation, with benefits for sportfish and non-sportfish species alike, as well as for North America's aquatic ecosystems.},

abstract = {Changes in species-specific angler behaviors from harvest oriented to
voluntary release have the potential to alter fish population and
community characteristics. In Escanaba Lake, Vilas County, Wisconsin,
targeted and indirect Muskellunge Esox masquinongy angler behavior
changed from harvest-oriented to primarily voluntary catch and release
(C{\&}R) during the mid-1990s. Since, the Muskellunge population has been
lightly exploited (mean exploitation {\{}[{\}}u] {\textless} 0.05), despite no closed
season, bag limit, or minimum length limit for Muskellunge, and can now
be characterized as a C{\&}R fishery. We tested for differences in
Muskellunge adult density, age-0 relative abundance, and size structure
indices as a consequence of changes in angler behavior and the
subsequent reduction in exploitation. Prior to the shift in angler
behavior, the Muskellunge population exhibited characteristics of an
exploited fishery (e.g., lower adult size structure, high and more
variable natural recruitment). After C{\&}R practices became prevalent,
the Muskellunge population exhibited characteristics of an unexploited
fishery (e.g., larger adult size structure, low and less variable
natural recruitment). Voluntary release of Muskellunge is an angler
behavior that is well recognized and promoted among present-day anglers.
We recommend that managers account for these changes in angler behavior
and associated population responses and adjust management strategies
accordingly. In particular, stocking practices and harvest regulations
need to be evaluated to ensure that those strategies are not negatively
influencing Muskellunge population dynamics and other associated fish
community characteristics.},

abstract = {Over 40{\%} of Great Lakes fishes are wetland dependent, and more than 70{\%}benefit from wetlands periodically. As such, restoration and rehabilitation of Great Lakes coastal wetlands have increased dramatically. This necessitates a balance among varied management objectives, including fish passage. The presence of water control structures commonly found on diked wetlands can limit fish passage if not open all the time. We sampled three diked Lake Erie coastal wetlands to assess how different structures affected fish passage.Water control structures included a pool-andweir fish ladder, swing gates, and an open culvert. Fyke nets were set five to seven times at each site between April and October 2015. One net was set outside of the wetland, a short distance away from the passage structure, and the other was set inside the wetland, with the net wings enclosing the opening of the structure. Catches were compared for catch rate, three measures of community similarity, and the wetland fish index (WFI). Fish communities on either side of the fish ladder site had low community similarities that were lower than those of the culvert site and similar to those of the swing gate site, suggesting that the fish ladder did not provide fish passage as hoped. Of the three wetlands, catches from inside the wetland with the culvert had a WFI that was most similar to those of wetlands connected to Lake Erie hydrology. Overall, the culvert provided the most opportunity for fish movement into the wetland. However, unlike the other structures, it did not provide a means for precisely managing wetland water levels.},

@article{Cooke2005a,
abstract = {Catch-and-release recreational angling has become very popular as a conservation strategy and as a fisheries management tool for a diverse array of fishes. Implicit in catch-and-release angling strategies is the assumption that fish experience low mortality and minimal sub-lethal effects. Despite the importance of this premise, research on this topic has focused on several popular North American sportfish, with negligible efforts directed towards understanding catch-and-release angling effects on alternative fish species. Here, we summarise the existing literature to develop five general trends that could be adopted for species for which no data are currently available: (1) minimise angling duration, (2) minimise air exposure, (3) avoid angling during extremes in water temperature, (4) use barbless hooks and artificial lures/flies, and (5) refrain from angling fish during the reproductive period. These generalities provide some level of protection to all species, but do have limitations. Therefore, we argue that a goal of conservation science and fisheries management should be the creation of species-specific guidelines for catch-and-release. These guidelines would take into account the inter-specific diversity of fishes and variation in fishing techniques. As recreational angling continues to grow in popularity, expanding to many developing countries, and targeting alternative species, it is important that reasonable data appropriate for specific fish and fisheries are available. The sustainable use and conservation of recreational fishery resources will depend upon the development and dissemination of effective catch-and-release angling strategies based upon sound science to stakeholders around the world. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.},

abstract = {This review summarizes the main cellular mechanisms involved in potassium regulation in plasma and skeletal muscle during exercise. The effects of exercise-induced hyperkalemia and post-exercise hypokalemia on the cardiac action potential are reviewed in light of recent research on Na+ and K+ channel activity. Specific consideration is given to K+ release from contracting skeletal muscle, K+ uptake by contracting skeletal muscle, K+ uptake by non-contracting tissues during the period of exercise, and K+ uptake by skeletal muscle recovering from contractile activity. The onset of exercise is associated with a net release of K+ from contracting skeletal muscle that results in an increase in plasma [K+]. Resultant decreases in intracellular [K+] and increases in interstitial [K+] in contracting skeletal muscle have been implicated in the fatigue process. The rate and magnitude of increase in plasma [K+] is dependent on exercise intensity, trained state of the individual, and on drugs such as beta-adrenoceptor blockers and caffeine. During exercise, the uptake of K+ from the blood by non-contracting tissues may be important in preventing plasma [K+] from rising to excessive levels that will impair skeletal muscle and myocardial excitability and contractility. Cessation of exercise results in a rapid decrease in plasma [K+], often to 3 mEq/l or less with intense exercise, that may be maintained for prolonged periods. The rapid increases and decreases in plasma [K+] with onset and cessation of exercise, respectively, has been implicated in altered myocardial function and sudden cardiac death. Recent studies suggest that increases in catecholamines during exercise are cardioprotective to the arrhythmogenic effects of hyperkalemia. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {The muskellunge Esox masquinongy is an important sport fish in Wisconsin and elsewhere, but more information about its diet is needed to better understand its role in aquatic systems and its effects on other fish. Stomach contents were examined for 1,092 muskellunge (2261,180 mm total length, TL) captured in the littoral zone from 34 Wisconsin water bodies from July 1991 to October 1994. Food occurred in 34.3{\%} (N 375) of the stomachs, with most (74{\%}) containing a single item. Overall, the proportion of muskellunge with food differed sig- nificantly among seasons, with the greatest proportion occurring in fall (69.0{\%}), followed by summer (53.5{\%}) and then spring (25.4{\%}). Prey items consisted of 547 fish, representing 12 families and 31 species, along with 35 nonfish items; fish composed 98{\%} of the diet. Relative importance values of diet items varied by taxa, season, and water body, but the main food items eaten by muskellunge in each season were yellow perch Perca flavescens and white sucker Catostomous commersoni. Black basses Micropterus spp., northern pike Esox lucius, walleye Stizostedion vitreum, cyprinids, and other taxa were less common in the diet. Prey fish ranged in size from 6{\%} to 47{\%} of muskellunge total length and prey length increased significantly as muskellunge size increased. Yet the size of prey in proportion to muskellunge size remained the same for all sizes of mus- kellunge. The results of this study indicate that, if readily available, yellow perch and catostomids will compose a large proportion of the muskellunge diet. Additional studies assessing muskellunge diet among lakes having different prey community types and assessing diet in deeper offshore areas of lakes are needed to better understand the role that muskellunge play in aquatic communities.},

abstract = {Angling for muskellunge (Esox masquinongy) is a specialized endeavor involving species-specific equipment and handling procedures. The latter were developed by anglers with little influence from fisheries managers or the scientific community. Today, release rates approach 100{\%} for specialized anglers; therefore, a formal evaluation of these procedures was warranted. Using two handling treatments - one to mimic current handling procedures with a period of air exposure and another gentler alternative without a period of air exposure - we assessed the physiological and behavioural disturbances as well as mortality associated with the catch-and-release process. Seventy-seven muskellunge were angled and blood sampled during the 2009 and 2010 muskellunge angling seasons. An additional 18 muskellunge were electrofished and immediately blood sampled to obtain baseline physiology data. A subsample (N=30, 15 per treatment) of the 77 angled individuals was fitted with external radio transmitters to assess behaviour and survival. Glucose and lactate concentrations were found to be significantly lower for controls, and glucose and potassium concentrations increased significantly with increasing surface water temperatures. No differences in physiology were noted between angling treatments. Muskellunge treated with normal and alternative handling procedures exhibited similar post-release behaviour, and no angling related mortalities were observed across a range of water temperatures (17.5-26.0°C) This study demonstrates the effectiveness of current handling procedures at minimizing physiological and behavioural disturbances, particularly when compared with a gentler alternative. A fishery in which no angling mortality exists is not possible, but our study provides support for the notion that angling related mortality for muskellunge captured and released by specialized anglers using handling procedures evaluated in this study may indeed be negligible. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The use of antibiotics, in particular, the use of a single dose of antibiotics during electronic tag implantation is of unproven value, and carries with it the potential for the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria and the alteration of the immune response of the fish. Antibiotic use during electronic tag implantation must conform to relevant drug laws and regulations in the country where work is being done, including the requirements for withdrawal times before human consumption is a possibility. Currently, the choice of antibiotics (most often tetracycline or oxytetracycline) and the use of a single dose of the drug are decisions made without knowledge of the basic need for antibiotic usage and of the bacteria involved in infections that occur following electronic tag implantation. Correct perioperative use of an antibiotic is to apply the drug to the animal before surgery begins, to assure serum and tissue levels of the drug are adequate before the incision is made. However, the most common perioperative application of antibiotics during implantation of an electronic tag is to delay the administration of the drug, injecting it into the coelom after the electronic tag is inserted, just prior to closure of the incision. There is little empirical evidence that the present application of antibiotics in fish being implanted with electronic tags is of value. Improvements should first be made to surgical techniques, especially the use of aseptic techniques and sterilized instruments and electronic tags, before resorting to antibiotics. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.(outside the USA).},

Because densities of Muskellunge in many reservoirs are low, escapement is a concern.

We used controlled laboratory experiments to examine how juvenile Muskellunge interact with flow over a barrier at varying levels of turbidity, flow rate, habitat availability, and periods in the diel cycle. In the field we inserted PIT tags into juvenile and adult Muskellunge, monitored their escapement over a dam with an antenna array, and then compared escapement among demographic groups and described escapement in relation to precipitation events, water temperature, and water clarity. Both laboratory and field studies found Muskellunge were more likely to escape during the day than at night. We estimated that 25{\%} of a reservoir Muskellunge population escaped within the 1-year period of this study, with escapement occurring during late spring but not during fall. Adults were more likely to escape than juveniles, and both sexes escaped at equal rates. Methods developed here can be used to provide useful information to managers and develop mitigation practices to limit escapement in situations where it is not desirable.},

abstract = {The Muskellunge Esox masquinongy is a highly sought-after sport fish that is native to the Tennessee River drainage of western North Carolina. After the extirpation of Muskellunge from North Carolina in the 1950s, the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission began a stocking program to re-establish the species and produce viable Muskellunge fisheries in North Carolina. Although stocking efforts have created a Muskellunge fishery in, for example, the French Broad River (where the species was native), there is little evidence of success in North Carolina sections of the New River (where the species was not native). Possible mechanisms inhibiting stocking success are unclear because there is relatively little information available on the juvenile life stage of the Muskellunge, especially in the southern portion of its distribution. We addressed the perceived differences in recruitment between the two fisheries by using telemetry to investigate dispersal, mortality, and habitat use by stocked juvenile Muskellunge. Fifty hatchery-reared, age-0 Muskellunge (282–307 mm TL) were tagged prior to stocking in the New River (fall 2013) and French Broad River (fall 2014). Three months after stocking, known survival of tagged fish was 4{\%} in the New River and 29{\%} in the French Broad River; the survival probability after 3 months was estimated at 9{\%} (range = 4–17{\%}) in the New River and 37{\%} (range = 25–56{\%}) in the French Broad River. Extended survival in the French Broad River was 14{\%} at 252 d poststocking. High dispersal was observed, with maximum individual dispersal of 67.4 km in the New River and 55.5 km in the French Broad River. Habitat suitability analyses indicated that juvenile Muskellunge in the FBR selected shallow nearshore areas with low water velocity, fine substrate, and substantial cover in the form of woody debris and overhanging vegetation. Information on the survival and behavior of stocked Muskellunge can facilitate efforts to successfully manage these fisheries.

The effects of these devices on the fish are largely unknown and to date have only been specifically quantified for bonefish Albula spp., which suffered serious injuries as a result of being handled with lip grippers. To investigate the effects of these grips on barramundi of a range of sizes, we held 21 fish (53–102 cm total length) above the water using lip grippers—10 without any additional support, and 11 with a hand holding them in a horizontal position—and compared survival and sublethal effects with those of 10 fish that had been held in landing nets for the same period of time (20 s). Two fish (7{\%}) died 10 d posttreatment, but death could not be attributed directly to any handling treatment. All fish held with lip grippers and receiving no additional support had small holes in the membranes of the lower jaw, compared with 81{\%} of fish that were held with lip grippers and supported by a hand. X-rays showed that lifting fish with lip grippers altered the alignment of the vertebrae, which did not return to normal after 3 weeks.},

We review the available liter-ature and focus on tools and techniques used for conducting surgery on juvenile salmonids because of the large amount of research that is conducted on them. The use of sterilized surgical instruments properly selected for a given size of fish will minimize tissue damage and infection rates, and speed the wound healing of fish implanted with transmitters. For the implantation of transmitters into small fish, the optimal surgical methods include making an incision on the ventral midline along the linea alba (for studies under 1 month), protecting the viscera (by lifting the skin with forceps while creating the incision), and using absorbable monofil-ament suture with a small-swaged-on swaged-on tapered or reverse-cutting needle. Standardizing the implantation techniques to be used in a study involving particular species and age classes of fish will improve survival and transmitter retention while allowing for comparisons to be made among studies and across multiple years.

The process of collecting, transporting, confining, handling, and spawning broodstock Muskellunge may cause mortality that could alter Muskellunge density, size structure, and population survival rates. We used long-term Muskellunge capture–recapture data collected from the Iowa Great Lakes and Clear Lake in northern Iowa to estimate the number and proportion of Muskellunge captured annually and the initial mortality rates resulting from broodstock collection. We also evaluated whether Muskellunge apparent survival rates differed between individuals used as broodstock and those that were not captured annually. Finally, we evaluated whether the number of initial mortalities or the number of individuals captured were related to annual population survival estimates. Collectively, 7,010 adult Muskellunge (3,896 males and 3,114 females) captures occurred between 2001 and 2017, and population densities within a system ranged from 0.11 to 0.39 fish/ha. An average of 33{\%} (range = 13–76{\%}) of the population was captured during broodstock operations annually. Between 0 and 28 (0.0000 to 0.0191 fish/ha) Muskellunge died at each hatchery annually, and more males died than females (total of 150 males and 68 females; 3.9{\%} and 2.2{\%} of captured fish, respectively). However, annual mortalities were generally a low proportion of Muskellunge in the lake ({\textless}2{\%}; {\textless}0.001 fish/ha). There was some evidence of size-selective mortality, particularly for males, where larger individuals (875–975 mm) were more likely to die, but we found no evidence to suggest that broodstock collection affected annual population survival estimates. Muskellunge broodstock mortality appears to act in a compensatory manner with natural mortality, and other sources of population mortality are more likely to have a greater effect on the population.},

Small baits ({\textless}75 mm) were more likely to hook the fish in the gills and less likely to hook the fish in the upper jaw than larger baits. It took longer to remove hooks from gills than from other hooking locations.

abstract = {Atlantic salmon Salmo safar, returning to freshwater to spawn, were angled and then terminally sampled to test the hypothesis that angling during warmer summer months (water temperatures of 20 :t 2°C) increases the magnitude of physiological disturbances in the white muscle. Angling immediately reduced white muscle ATP and phosphocreatine stores, but these high-energy phosphates were replenished within 2-4 h. Intramuscular glycogen stores were nearly depleted after angling, but unlike the response by salmon angled in the fall at 6°C, there was no glycogen resynthesis during the 4-h recovery period. Marked increases in white muscle lactate and the postexer{\textless};ise metabolic proton load (AH;;,) accompanied glycogen depletion. The time course of lactate elimination and AH;;' correction, however, was much slower than previously observed in fall-angled salmon. Finally, considerable delayed postangling mortality (40{\%}) was observed in a subgroup of Atlantic salmon that were angled at 22°C. We conclude that angling in warm summer water impairs restorative processes and increases the susceptibility of Atlantic salmon to delayed postangling mortality. We suggest that anglers can mitigate the magnitude of angling-induced physiological disturbances in Atlantic salmon during midsummer by minimizing playing time and postangling air exposure.},

abstract = {Catch-and-release (C{\&}R) angling is widely practised by anglers and is a common fisheries management strategy or is a by-product of harvest regulations. Accordingly, there is a growing body of research that examines not only the mortality associated with C{\&}R, but also the sublethal physiological and behavioural consequences. Biotelemetry offers a powerful means of remotely monitoring the behaviour, physiology and mortality of fish caught and released in their natural environment, but we contend that its usefulness is still underappreciated by scholars and managers. In this study, we review the applications of biotelemetry in C{\&}R science, identify novel research directions, opportunities and challenges. There are now about 250 C{\&}R studies but only one quarter of these utilize biotelemetry. In fact, almost all of the C{\&}R studies that have used biotelemetry have been conducted within the last decade. We found that the majority of C{\&}R telemetry studies used either radio or acoustic telemetry, while comparatively few studies have used satellite technologies. Most C{\&}R biotelemetry studies have been used to assess mortality rates, behavioural impairments or to evaluate the effects of displacement on fish. A small fraction of studies ({\textless}8{\%}) have used physiological sensors despite the fact that these tools are highly applicable to understanding the multiple sublethal consequences of C{\&}R and are useful for providing mechanistic insights into endpoints such as death. We conclude that C{\&}R science has the potential to benefit greatly from biotelemetry technology, particularly with respect to providing more robust short-term and delayed mortality estimates and adopting a more integrative and comparative approach to understanding the lethal and sublethal impacts of C{\&}R. However, there are still a number of challenges including (i) the need for appropriate controls and methodological approaches, (ii) the need for accounting for tagging and handling stress and mortality, and (iii) the need for certainty in assessing mortality. However, the benefits associated with C{\&}R biotelemetry outweigh its disadvantages and limitations and thereby offer C{\&}R researchers a suite of new tools to enhance fisheries management and conservation. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

Reduced metabolic rate in winter was consistent with the metabolic compensation hypothesis, implying that metabolism of muskellunge varies independently of acclimation temperature and gonadogenesis. Moreover, seasonal variation in metabolic rate has important implications for energy budget studies. Single-season estimates of esocid metabolism may be inadequate to describe annual energy requirements; the magnitude of errors will depend on the time of year metabolic rate was measured. As a result, it is suggested that seasonal variation in metabolic rate be incorporated into energy budget determinations for fishes. (C) 2000 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.},

abstract = {Intraspecific genetic variation across the distribution of Muskellunge Esox masquinongy suggests the existence of divergent stocks among major river drainages. Often, stocks differentiate in response to latitudinal variation in thermal regime. Genetic variation and thermal adaptation may drive fish to either maximize growth during brief growing seasons at higher latitudes (counter-gradient growth) or experience longer periods of slower growth at lower latitudes (cogradient growth). The strength and direction of these genetic effects matter for fish stocked outside of their native drainage and for populations experiencing changes to regional thermal regimes. We used a replicated pond experiment with uniform initial fish size and environmental conditions to compare the survival and growth of stocked age-0 Ohio River drainage (OH) Muskellunge with those of the more northerly upper Mississippi River drainage (MISS) stock following their first winter and a year after introduction into a common environment. Both stocks had similarly high winter survival, though the MISS stock had a slower growth rate overwinter than the OH stock. Survival during the latter spring-to-fall period was greatly reduced for the MISS stock, however, with the differences in growth rate persisting. These findings suggest that cogradient adaptation to temperatures experienced during early life stages in native environments results in a disadvantage for high-latitude stocks of Muskellunge in thermal regimes warmer than those they have historically experienced in their native drainages.},

However, to our knowledge, no studies have observed the amount of time anglers actually expose fish to air when recreationally fishing. We observed 280 anglers on several waters where catch and release was commonly practiced for trout and timed how long they exposed trout to air before releasing them back to the water. We also noted several angling characteristics to evaluate whether they influenced air exposure times, including the type of gear (fly, lure, bait), fishing on foot or from a boat, handling method (hand, net), and a subjective measure of trout size (small, medium, large). The longest continuous interval that anglers exposed trout to air averaged 26.1 s (range, 0-160 s), and only 4{\%}of the anglers held fish out of thewater continuously for {\textgreater}60 s. Total air exposure averaged 29.4 s, ranged from0 to 165 s, and differed from the longest air exposure by only 3.3 s because most of the released trout (78{\%}) were held out of the water only one time. Anglers who handled trout by hand (rather than using a landing net) and used flies (rather than bait or lures) held fish out of water for less time. Larger trout were exposed to air longer (x = 36.0 s) than small (x = 22.5 s) or medium-sized (x = 27.1 s) trout. However, no angling characteristic increased air exposure by more than 14 s. Fight time averaged 53.0 s and ranged from 7 to 128 s.We conclude that from an air exposure perspective, most of the trout released by anglers in our study were not exposed to air for times that would cause mortality or substantively increase sublethal effects from catch and release.},

A laboratory experiment was conducted to investigate the recovery dynamics of physiological indicators of stress resulting from a simulated angling event resulting in exhaustion, with and without additional air exposure of 300 s. In addition, a field study using a combination of physiological and behavioural assessment was conducted to assess the long-term consequences of exhaustive exercise and various air exposure durations. Exhaustive exercise for 60 s led to increased muscle lactate, decreased tissue energy stores, and alterations in plasma ionic status. Recovery from physiological disturbance was rapid with all physiological variables except plasma glucose returning to baseline levels after 6 h. The recovery profile was largely unaffected by air exposure of 300 s that simulated extended de-hooking time. The field component of our study verified the impact of exhaustive exercise on blood lactate values, but did not detect any impact of air exposure varying between 0 s and 300 s on physiological stress indicators. However, pike exposed to air for 300 s were behaviourally impaired in the first hour post-release indicating that despite limited effects on physiological status air exposure resulted in significant impairment of organismal performance. Behavioural patterns returned to normal within several hours. In a three-week post-release monitoring period no mortality occurred. Our results emphasize that angling-induced stressors result in physiological and behavioural disturbances, but that recovery is quick. This suggests that pike are relatively resilient to catch-and-release related stressors but air exposure durations should be kept {\textless}300 s to minimize behavioural impairment. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Apparently, fish have evolved to fit into 'thermal niches' to optimize physiological, ecological, and reproductive performance in their native habitats. However, man has perturbed many of these habitats to the point where previously advantageous thermal preference behavior may now be inappropriate. Thermal perturbations are the most obviously related examples of man's interference, but a fish's inherent thermal preference behavior can also magnify the biological effects of changes in dissolved oxygen, food supply, toxicants, and physical barriers. Environmental management should (1) consider thermal preference behavior when evaluating habitat suitability, (2) manage for needed temperature and thermal structure, and (3) give priority attention to minimizing degradation of preferred thermal habitat, especially when it is in short supply. {\textcopyright} 1987 Dr W.

To allow successful transmitter attachment, numerous methods to anesthetize the study fish, with varied impact and effectiveness, may be employed. Following anesthetization, three standard methods of transmitter attachment have been developed - external attachment, intragastric insertion, and surgical implantation. Although each method has advantages and disadvantages, their success largely depends on factors such as the species, environment, fish and transmitter size, and duration of the telemetry study. Additionally, each method of attachment can affect experimental fish physiology and behavior in varying ways. After describing each of the transmitter attachment procedures, we review the effects of transmitter presence and attachment procedure on fish physiology and behavior, with special focus on implications to aquaculture and fisheries related studies. {\textcopyright}2003 by CRC Press LLC.},

abstract = {Sport fisheries for muskellunge Esox masquinongy are often sustained by stocking. Size-selective mortality has been identified as an important factor affecting stocked muskellunge. However, this mortality is difficult to assess because its effects on the population can be confounded by growth. To partition observed shifts in length frequencies of stocked muskellunge into growth and mortality effects, two lots each of approximately 1,000 hatchery-reared muskellunge fingerlings were sorted into 10-mm size-groups, marked with size specific fin clips, and stocked into two northwestern Wisconsin lakes. Beginning 30 d after stocking, we used electrofishing to examine length distributions and estimate abundance of stocked fish. Shifts in the length-frequency distributions after stocking were found to be caused by size-selective mortality and growth. Mortality was highest for the smallest fish. A size-based analysis indicated that growth in fall contributed far more than size-selective mortality contributed to changes in length distributions. Our analysis suggests that it may be important to monitor the fate of size-classes within cohorts if cohort dynamics are to be fully understood.},

abstract = {A unique population of muskellunge Esox masquinongy inhabits Shoepack Lake in Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota. Little is known about its status, dynamics, and angler exploitation, and there is concern for the long-term viability of this population. We used intensive sampling and mark-recapture methods to quantify abundance, survival, growth, condition, age at maturity and fecundity and angler surveys to quantify angler pressure, catch rates, and exploitation. During our study, heavy rain washed out a dam constructed by beavers Castor canadensis which regulates the water level at the lake outlet, resulting in a nearly 50{\%} reduction in surface area. We estimated a population size of 1,120 adult fish at the beginning of the study. No immediate reduction in population size was detected in response to the loss of lake area, although there was a gradual, but significant, decline in population size over the 2-year study. Adults grew less than 50 mm per year, and relative weight (W r) averaged roughly 80. Anglers were successful in catching, on average, two fish during a full day of angling, but harvest was negligible. Shoepack Lake muskellunge exhibit much slower growth rates and lower condition, but much higher densities and angler catch per unit effort (CPUE), than other muskellunge populations. The unique nature, limited distribution, and location of this population in a national park require special consideration for management. The results of this study provide the basis for assessing the long-term viability of the Shoepack Lake muskellunge population through simulations of long-term population dynamics and genetically effective population size. {\textcopyright} Copyright by the American Fisheries Society 2007.},

abstract = {Miniature Thermochron iButton dataloggers have transformed the ways in which researchers collect thermal data. However, one important limitation is that these dataloggers are not waterproof, which can lead to device failure and loss of data under field conditions. Several methods have been used to increase their water resistance, but no study to date has investigated whether any of these techniques affects the accuracy of temperature readings. Waterproofing potentially could affect the accuracy of iButtons by biasing temperatures or altering rates of warming and cooling. We compared temperature profiles of unmodified Thermochron iButtons (model DS1921G) to iButtons that we coated with a clear plastic dip (designed to coat tool handles) to determine whether this waterproof coating affects the accuracy of temperatures they record. We also compared temperatures recorded by uncoated and coated iButtons that were embedded within physical models that mimic frog body temperatures. Finally, we used our field data to test whether coating iButtons with plastic prevents failure of dataloggers during fieldwork. Although we found statistically significant differences between the temperatures recorded by uncoated and coated iButtons, and also between uncoated and coated iButtons embedded in frog models, these effects were relatively small (0-1.3 °C). We also found that coating iButtons with plastic reduced the likelihood of device failure under field conditions (from 8.3{\%} to 0{\%}). We conclude that coating Thermochron iButtons with plastic is an affordable and reliable method of waterproofing dataloggers that prevents device failure and data loss with minimal influence on temperature readings. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Striped bass Morone saxatilis has a paradoxical record of distribution and abundance, including population declines in coastal waters and variable success of freshwater introductions. This record is analyzed for consistency with a hypothesis that striped bass are "squeezed" between their thermal and dissolved oxygen preferences or requirements. A commonality among diverse field and lab- oratory observations supports an inherent thermal niche for the species that changes to lower temperatures as fish age. This shift can cause local conditions, especially warm surface strata and deoxygenated deep water, to be incompatible with the success of large fish. Crowding due to temperature preferences alone or coupled with avoidance of low oxygen concentrations can lead to pathology and overfishing, which may contribute to population declines. Through a mixture of evidence and conjecture, the thermal niche-dissolved oxygen hypothesis is proposed as a unified perspective of the habitat requirements of the species that can aid in its study and management.},

Morone chrysops (227–410 mm total length) that had been surgically implanted with simulated transmitters and held at high (22–29?C) and low (12–18?C) temperatures for 120 d. Fish were individually examined after 7, 30, 60, 90, and 120 d to evaluate suture and wound condition as well as transmitter loss. Neither suture material nor antenna placement affected transmitter loss, mortality, or growth at either high or low temperatures. Absorbable sutures were lost more quickly than were nonabsorbable sutures, but they persisted beyond incision closure at both high and low temperatures. At high temperatures, 50{\%} suture loss occurred by 30 d for absorbable sutures and by 60 d for nonabsorbable sutures. Mortality occurred only at high temperatures but was delayed and was likely caused by peritoneal infection. Transmitter loss was not significant; it occurred only in the low-temperature trial and was caused by pressure necrosis at the incision rather than by suture failure. Temperature significantly affected all responses examined in this study. Signif- icant irritation, infection, and mortality occurred in all treatment groups at high temperatures.},

Analysis of a test data set indicated that both the form of index and properties of the data set size can dictate the patterns of condition observed. The various indices were reviewed in terms of appropriateness, simplicity and statistical correctness. It was concluded that an index should be selected only after a detailed examination of both the underlying assumptions of the index and the properties of the data set.

abstract = {Recent research has shown the possibility of pain perception in fish; therefore, the use of analgesia or " painkillers" should be considered for invasive procedures. However, there is relatively little information on the effectiveness of analgesic drugs nor on the appropriate dose for fish. This study assessed the efficacy of three types of drug: an opioid, buprenorphine, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), carprofen and a local anaesthetic, lidocaine. Each drug was tested at three doses on rainbow trout that were noxiously stimulated and the most effective dose was also given to fish experiencing no pain to investigate side-effects. Ventilation rate and time to resume feeding were used as pain indicators, together with the amount of activity and plasma cortisol concentrations to gauge any detrimental side effects. Buprenorphine at all three doses had limited impact on the fish's response to a painful stimulus. Carprofen ameliorated effects of noxious stimulation on time to resume feeding but activity was reduced more than by noxious treatment alone. Lidocaine reduced all of the pain indicators measured with the lowest, most effective dose being 1. mg per fish. None of the analgesics led to raised plasma cortisol compared to control groups. This study demonstrates that lidocaine could be recommended for use in rainbow trout to ameliorate possible pain-related responses. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The literature indicates that most species resident in the Great Lakes basin spend at least part of their first year of life in lentic habitats. Young-of-the-year of the majority of these species inhabit habitats less than two metres deep during at least part of the year. Most species were associated with a variety of substrates in their first year of life, but sand and silt were the most commonly used. Vegetation, particulary submergent vegetation, was also an important factor. The combination of these characteristics emphasizes the importance of wetlands, and other relatively low energy near-shore environments, for nursery habitat. This is in contrast to areas of bedrock and hard-pan clay, which are used by few species.},

abstract = {We provide a computer program (AGE-KEY) that quickly implements an age-length key approach for estimating fish population age structure and mean lengths at age. The program's approach to age assignment differs from previous approaches in that ages are explicitly assigned to individual unaged fish. Because individual age assignment is necessary to describe the variation around estimates of mean catch per effort (CPE) at age and to compare these estimates through standard statistical procedures, the number of fish of a specified age captured in each unit of effort must be known or estimated. Individual age assignment can be confounded by instances of fractionality, where ages cannot be evenly assigned to fish within individual length intervals. Program AGEKEY resolves the problem of fractionality by applying an integer-based approach to age assignment. When we tested the validity of the program with two sample data sets, AGEKEY yielded estimates of age frequency and mean lengths at age that were very similar to estimates calculated through spreadsheet approaches. Program AGEKEY can quickly derive estimates of age frequency and mean lengths at age using an age-length key approach that will provide users with the data necessary to describe the precision associated with estimates of CPE at age and allow for statistical comparisons of CPE at age across surveys.},

abstract = {Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were acclimated and exhaustively exercised at 12, 18, or 23 °C to determine how temperature influences the magnitude of postexercise physiological disturbances. At each temperature, exercise led to decreased white muscle ATP and phosphocreatine concentrations. Phosphocreatine was rapidly restored within 1 h at each temperature whereas ATP restoration took 1-4 h at 18 and 23°C, but considerably longer at 12°C. Exercise-induced depletions of white muscle glycogen were accompanied by elevations in muscle lactate, which contributed to 0.6 unit decreases in white muscle intracellular pH (pH(i)) at each temperature. Compared with rates of recovery in warmer water, glycogen resynthesis, lactate catabolism, and pH(i) correction were slower at 12°C. White muscle REDOX state estimates suggested that slower postexercise recovery at 12°C was not due to oxygen delivery limitations. Marked postexercise elevations in plasma osmolality and lactate concentration were also observed and in each case correction of the disturbance took longer at 12°C. Paradoxically, significant mortality (30{\%}) was observed only at 23°C. We conclude that while warmer water facilitates postexercise recovery of white muscle metabolic and acid base status in Atlantic salmon, extremely high temperatures may make them more vulnerable to delayed postexercise mortality.},

abstract = {Biotelemetry is a useful tool to monitor the movements of animals and is widely applied in fisheries research. Radio or acoustic technology can be used, depending on the study design and the environmental conditions in the study area. A broad definition of telemetry also includes the use of Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags, either separately or with a radio or acoustic transmitter. To use telemetry, fish must be equipped with a transmitter. Although there are several attachment procedures available, surgical implantation of transmitters in the abdominal cavity is recognized as the best technique for long-term telemetry studies in general (Stasko and Pincock, 1977; Winter, 1996; Jepsen, 2003), and specifically for juvenile salmonids, Oncorhynchus spp. (Adams and others, 1998a, 1998b; Martinelli and others, 1998; Hall and others, 2009). Studies that use telemetry assume that the processes by which the animals are captured, handled, and tagged, as well as the act of carrying the transmitter, will have minimal effect on their behavior and performance. This assumption, commonly stated as a lack of transmitter effects, must be valid if telemetry studies are to describe accurately the movements and behavior of an entire population of interest, rather than the subset of that population that carries transmitters. This document describes a standard operating procedure (SOP) for surgical implantation of radio or acoustic transmitters in juvenile salmonids. The procedures were developed from a broad base of published information, laboratory experiments, and practical experience in tagging thousands of fish for numerous studies of juvenile salmon movements near Columbia River and Snake River hydroelectric dams. Staff from the Western Fisheries Research Center's Columbia River Research Laboratory (CRRL) frequently have used telemetry studies to evaluate new structures or operations at hydroelectric dams in the Columbia River Basin, and these evaluations typically require large numbers of tagged fish. For example, a study conducted at the dams on the Columbia River and funded by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers required tagging and monitoring of 40,000 juvenile salmon during a 3-month migration period (Counihan and others, 2006a, 2006b; Perry and others, 2006). To meet the demands of such a large study, the authors and CRRL staff refined the SOP to increase efficiency in the tagging process while maintaining high standards of fish care. The SOP has been used in laboratory and field settings for more than 15 years, and consistently has produced low mortality rates ({\textless}1 percent) and transmitter loss rates ({\textless}0.01 percent) in the 24-36 hours after tagging. In addition to describing the detailed surgical procedures required for transmitter implantation, this document provides guidance on fish collection, handling and holding, and the release of tagged fish. Although often overlooked, or at least underemphasized, these processes can have a large impact on the outcome of the tagging procedure. Stress associated with the individual steps in handling and tagging can be cumulative and lethal (Maule and others, 1988; Wedemeyer and others, 1990; Portz and others, 2006), so the goal is to provide the best possible fish care at every step in order to manage the overall effect on study fish.},

Underlying assumptions of such studies include minimal tag loss and negligible effects on the behavior, fitness, and survival of tagged individuals. Passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags are becoming increasingly commonplace, largely because of their small size, ease of implantation, longevity, and reportedly high rates of retention. We evaluated tag retention and survival and growth effects on age-0 muskellunge Esox masquinongy marked with PIT tags at two implantation sites, the peritoneal cavity and the dorsal musculature, during overwinter trials in Illinois and Wisconsin. For both trials, no significant differences in survival (88.0-89.8{\%}), relative daily growth (0.0006-100062 mm.mm(-1).d(-1)), or tag retention (99.5-99.8{\%}) were observed among the two implantation groups and a control group. Survival and tag retention were also similar between trials. Our findings suggest that PIT tags implanted either in the peritoneal cavity or the dorsal musculature are acceptable for use in marking age-0 muskellunge.},

Encounter information from live captures, live resightings, and dead recoveries can be incorporated to estimate demographic parameters. Available estimates include survival (S or $\phi$), rate of population change ($\lambda$), transition rates between strata ($\Psi$), emigration and immigration rates, and population size (N). Although N is the parameter most often desired by biologists, N is one of the most difficult parameters to estimate precisely without bias for a geographically and demographically closed population. The set of closed population estimation models available in Program MARK incorporate time (t) and behavioral (b) variation, and individual heterogeneity (h) in the estimation of capture and recapture probabilities in a likelihood framework. The full range of models from M0 (null model with all capture and recapture probabilities equal) to Mtbh are possible, including the ability to include temporal, group, and individual covariates to model capture and recapture probabilities. Both the full likelihood formulation of Otis et al. (1978) and the conditional model formulation of Huggins (1989, 1991) and Alho (1990) are provided in Program MARK, and all of these models are incorporated into the robust design (Kendall et al. 1995, 1997; Kendall and Nichols 1995) and robust-design multistrata (Hestbeck et al. 1991, Brownie et al. 1993) data types.

abstract = {Reported improvements in the muskellunge angling fishery on Lake of the Woods, Ontario over the last two decades have paralleled an increase in the practice of catch and release angling, and an increase in minimum size regulations for this species. The overall status of muskellunge populations in this large, complex lake has proven difficult to monitor using standard assessment methods. A volunteer muskellunge angler diary program, established in 1988, has provided a cost effective method of gathering a large amount of information with which to track this fishery and associated populations. Results from angling diaries indicated increased angling effort, catch and success rates for muskellunge on Lake of the Woods since the early 1990s. Although the month of July accounted for the majority of angling effort and catch, angling success rates and sizes of fish reported in diaries improved monthly into the late fall. Angling success rates were consistently higher in angling diaries than from creel surveys, but both survey types showed similar long-term trends in the fishery. Angler diary data, incorporating both the numbers of fish caught and/or seen by anglers, were used to calculate catch equality indices which proved to be sensitive to changes in population abundance. Increased minimum length regulations for muskellunge during 1987-2001 have been largely responsible for a decline in harvest rates from an estimated 36{\%} in 1986 to 0{\%} since 1999. Although higher size limits have yet to produce more quality-sized fish in angler catches, diary survey data, supported by recent improvements in catch rates from assessment gill nets, would indicate that muskellunge recruitment has increased. This article concludes with a brief review of how muskellunge angler diary data has been used in the past, including recommendations to minimize biases associated with this survey method. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

ConclusionA fish is chased with a net in an aquarium before being captured, scooped out of the water, and placed in a nearby testing arena. Is it stressed? How can we tell? Are our indicators reliable? Quantification of stress in fish has evolved from the initial development of radioimmunoassays to measure cortisol in plasma to the rapidly expanding suite of genome-based assays. Indicators range from the intracellular to whole-animal level. Expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and activity of metabolic enzymes can be paired with straightforward observations of reflexes and survival. Both traditional and emerging indicators have advantages and disadvantages, and their use is tissue- and context-specific. Ecological, biological, and methodological factors must be considered when selecting, measuring, and interpreting stress indicators. Inter- and intraspecific, sex, life stage, and temporal differences in physiological responses to stressors can confound confirmation of a stressed state. Despite numerous types of indicators, our understanding of how absolute levels of indicators relate to stressor severity and recovery to date remains limited. How accurately indicators characterize stress in wild populations naturally exposed to stressors is still an evolving discussion. The integration of research disciplines and involvement of stakeholders and user groups will aid in filling these knowledge gaps, as well as the translation of individual-level indicators to population- and ecosystem-level processes.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 by the author(s). Successful conservation of migratory birds demands we understand how habitat factors on the breeding grounds influences breeding success. Multiple factors are known to directly influence breeding success in territorial songbirds. For example, greater food availability and fewer predators can have direct effects on breeding success. However, many of these same habitat factors can also result in higher conspecific density that may ultimately reduce breeding success through density dependence. In this case, there is a negative indirect effect of habitat on breeding success through its effects on conspecific density and territory size. Therefore, a key uncertainty facing land managers is whether important habitat attributes directly influence breeding success or indirectly influence breeding success through territory size. We used radio-telemetry, point-counts, vegetation sampling, predator observations, and insect sampling over two years to provide data on habitat selection of a steeply declining songbird species, the Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis). These data were then applied in a hierarchical path modeling framework and an AIC model selection approach to determine the habitat attributes that best predict breeding success. Canada Warblers had smaller territories in areas with high shrub cover, in the presence of red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), at shoreline sites relative to forest-interior sites and as conspecific density increased. Breeding success was lower for birds with smaller territories, which suggests competition for limited food resources, but there was no direct evidence that food availability influenced territory size or breeding success. The negative relationship between shrub cover and territory size in our study may arise because these specific habitat conditions are spatially heterogeneous, whereby individuals pack into patches of preferred breeding habitat scattered throughout the landscape, resulting in reduced territory size and an associated reduction in resource availability per territory. Our results therefore highlight the importance of considering direct and indirect effects for Canada warblers; efforts to increase the amount of breeding habitat may ultimately result in lower breeding success if habitat availability is limited and negative density dependent effects occur.},

If populations are not isolated then differences in population parameters between the two types of systems should not be evident. White crappies were collected in April-May 1987 using trap nets. Length frequencies of white crappies were not similar between diked wetlands and adjacent areas, and mean lengths were significantly less in the diked wetlands. Populations were not comprised of similar age classes in the 5 systems. White crappies in diked wetlands grew significantly slower than their conspecifics in the undiked areas.

abstract = {—From an ecological perspective, predation, competition or resource partitioning, and abiotic factors interact to affect species distribution and abundance. To make management rec-ommendations, I review research dealing with the relative influence of these factors in determining stocking success of muskellunge Esox masquinongy. Survival of stocked muskellunge is affected by losses to resident predators. Prey preference and composition are also important, and better muskellunge survival and growth occurs in systems with soft-rayed or fusiform prey rather than in centrarchid-dominated systems. However, potential for competition with resident fishes has not been carefully considered. Abiotic factors, particularly temperature, can influence stocking mor-tality and subsequent growth. Survival increases with size and is maximized with large muskellunge fingerlings (Ͼ240 mm), but cost-effectiveness can vary substantially with predator and prey pop-ulations. Hatchery rearing techniques can also affect muskellunge stocking success. Pellet-reared fish have lower survival than minnow-reared fish because predation mortality is higher, but both groups exhibit similar food consumption and growth. The parental population can affect survival and growth because temperature-related differences in bioenergetic variables occur among mus-kellunge populations. In addition to compromising genetic integrity, the mixing of populations with different physiological characteristics may have negative consequences for native populations. Thermal regimes of recipient waters should be considered in choosing the most appropriate pop-ulation for stocking outside the native range. Muskellunge stocking should be pursued within an ecological context that integrates the relative importance of predation, competition, and abiotic factors. This framework provides a guide for making management decisions concerning popula-tions, hatchery rearing techniques, sizes, and timing of muskellunge introductions into systems with specific characteristics.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s). Background: Intracoelomic implantation of electronic tags has become a common method in fishery research, but rarely are fish examined by scientists after release to understand the extent that surgical incisions have healed. Walleye (Sander vitreus) are a valuable, highly exploited fishery resource in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Here, fishery capture of walleye with internal acoustic transmitters combined with a high reward program provided multiple opportunities to examine photographs and quantify the status of surgical incisions. Walleye (n = 926) from reef and river spawning populations in Lake Erie and Lake Huron were implanted with acoustic transmitters during spring spawning events from 2011 to 2016. Incisions were closed with polydioxanone monofilament using two to three interrupted sutures. Out of 276 recaptured fish, 60 incision sites were clearly visible in photographs, and these were scored by two independent readers for incision closure, inflammation, and the presence of sutures. Results: While incision sites were completely closed by 61 days post-release (95{\%} CI 44-94), sutures remained for up to 866 days. Sutures were expelled serially during a protracted period, and the probability of observing at least one suture in a recaptured fish declined below 50{\%} after 673 days (95{\%} CI 442-1016). Inflammation at the incision increased during the first 71 days and then declined monotonically, remaining detectable at low levels. Conclusion: Our results emphasized that sutures remained in free-ranging fish past the time when they were beneficial for incision healing. Most dissolvable sutures have been designed for use in endotherms where the body temperature and internal milieu differ dramatically from the conditions experienced by fishes in temperate climates. Identification of new suture materials for fish that facilitate healing while absorbing or dissolving in a reasonable period (e.g., a few weeks to three months) in colder temperatures (e.g.,  {\textless} 12 °C) would be beneficial to mitigate potential adverse impacts from inflammation at the incision.},

abstract = {Current understanding of the stress response in fishes has largely come from studies of freshwater-adapted salmonids, with proportionately few comparative studies having examined marine fishes. The current study sought to quantify the magnitude of physiological disturbances, recovery dynamics, and post-exercise behaviour in bonefish (Albula vulpes; a tropical marine fish) exposed to several different exercise and air exposure regimens. Results showed that metabolic disturbances (lactate production, hyperglycemia) increased following exercise and exposure to air, and that the magnitude of metabolic disturbance was proportional to the duration of the stressful event. Fish required between 2-4 h to return to resting values. Exercise and exposure to air also resulted in significant increases in plasma Ca2+, Cl- and Na+, but the magnitude of these ionic changes did not vary with exercise or exposure to air duration and required over 4-h to return to baseline levels. Mortality following exercise was observed only for fish that had been exposed to air for 3 min and not in fish that had been exposed to air for 1 min. Together, results from this study provide a physiological basis for management strategies that can improve the post-release survival of bonefish that have been caught during a catch-and-release angling event. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

For surgical procedures, a number of skills are necessary to reduce mistakes. Trainees must learn an extensive yet standardized set of problem-solving and technical skills to handle challenges as they arise. There are currently no guidelines or consistent training methods for those intending to implant electronic tags in fish; this is surprising, considering documented cases of negative consequences of fish surgeries and information from studies having empirically tested fish surgical techniques. Learning how to do fish surgery once is insufficient for ensuring the maintenance or improvement of surgical skill. Assessment of surgical skills is rarely incorporated into training, and is needed. Evaluation provides useful feedback that guides future learning, fosters habits of self-reflection and self-remediation, and promotes access to advanced training. Veterinary professionals should be involved in aspects of training to monitor basic surgical principles. We identified attributes related to knowledge, understanding, and skill that surgeons must demonstrate prior to performing fish surgery including a ‘‘hands-on'' assessment using live fish. Included is a summary of common problems encountered by fish surgeons. We conclude by presenting core competencies that should be required as well as outlining a 3-day curriculum for training surgeons to conduct intracoelomic implantation of electronic tags. This curriculum could be offered through professional fisheries societies as professional development courses.},

abstract = {The practice of catch and release (CR) as a ﬁsheries management tool to reduce ﬁshing mortality is widely applied in both freshwater and marine ﬁsheries, whether from shifts in angler attitudes related to harvest or from the increasing use of harvest restrictions such as closed seasons or length limits. This approach assumes that for CR ﬁshing policies to beneﬁt the stock, CR will result in much lower mortality than would otherwise occur. There are many challenges in the design of CR studies to assess mortality, and in many practical settings it is diﬃcult to obtain accurate and precise estimates. The focus of this article is on the design and quantitative aspects of estimating CR mortality, the need for a comprehensive approach that explicitly states all components of CR mortality, and the assumptions behind these methods. A general conceptual model for CR mortality that is applicable to containment and tagging-based studies with a slight modiﬁcation is presented. This article reviews the design and analysis of containment and tagging studies to estimate CR mortality over both the short and long term and then compares these two approaches. Additionally, the potential population-level impacts of CR mortality are discussed.

abstract = {Over the past 20 years, there has been a dramatic increase in the use of physiological tools and experimental approaches for the study of the biological consequences of catch-and-release angling practices for fishes. Beyond simply documenting problems, physiological data are also being used to test and refine different strategies for handling fish such that stress is minimised and survival probability maximised, and in some cases, even for assessing and facilitating recovery post-release. The inherent sensitivity of physiological processes means that nearly every study conducted has found some level of - unavoidable - physiological disturbance arising from recreational capture and subsequent release. An underlying tenet of catch-and-release studies that incorporate physiological tools is that a link exists between physiological status and fitness. In reality, finding such relationships has been elusive, with further extensions of individual-level impacts to fish populations even more dubious. A focus of this article is to describe some of the challenges related to experimental design and interpretation that arise when using physiological tools for the study of the biological consequences of catch-and-release angling. Means of overcoming these challenges and the extrapolation of physiological data from individuals to the population level are discussed. The argument is presented that even if it is difficult to demonstrate strong links to mortality or other fitness measures, let alone population-level impacts of catch-and-release, there remains merit in using physiological tools as objective indicators of fish welfare, which is an increasing concern in recreational fisheries. The overarching objective of this paper is to provide a balanced critique of the use of physiological approaches in catch-and-release science and of their role in providing meaningful information for anglers and managers. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Thirty subadult and adult muskellunge tagged internally with temperature-sensing radio tags were tracked from March 2010 to March 2011 in a Tennessee reservoir. Mean tag temperatures were 18.9 °C in spring (March to May), 22.1 °C in summer (June to August), 16.5 °C in autumn and 9.8 °C in winter (December to February). When the greatest range in water temperatures was available (7.1-33.3 °C; May to early August 2010), their realised thermal niche (mean ± 1 SD) was 22.3 °C ± 1.8; the realised thermal niche was affected by fish size (smaller fish selected slightly warmer temperatures) but not sex. An electric generating steam plant discharging warm water resumed operation in January 2011, and most (86{\%}) tagged fish occupied the plume where temperatures were ≈10 °C warmer than ambient water temperatures. No mortalities were observed 15 days later when plant operations ceased. Their affinity for the heated plume prompted concerns that muskellunge will be too easily exploited when the plant operates during winter.},

We developed a 75-percentile equation using the regression-line-percentile method. The proposed equation, based on all fish combined, is log10Ws(g) = −6.066 + 3.325 log10TL(mm). The English equivalent for this equation is log10Ws(lb) = −4.052 + 3.325 log10TL(in). This equation is useful for 38 cm and longer muskellunge, and there was no evidence of consistent trends in increasing or decreasing Wr with increasing fish length. Because muskellunge can be sexed based on external characteristics, we also developed separate Ws equations for male and female muskellunge. However, Wr values calculated with the combined equation were quite similar (Wr values within 1–2) to those for values calculated from the female-only Ws equation. Values calculated with the male-only Ws equation were slightly more variable. {\textcopyright} Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

The vulnerability of tiger muskellunge to angling produced a substantial catch-and-release fishery: 226 hybrids stocked in 1981 and 1982 were caught 388 times (1.7 times per fish) during four fishing seasons, and 27 others were recovered in the draining census in 1985. Only four legal fish ( greater than or equal to 762 mm in total length) were harvested. Strict enforcement of a 762-mm minimum-length limit failed to generate a productive and cost-effective trophy fishery. The cost of each trophy fish harvested at Ridge Lake was prohibitively (US {\$}100). {\textgreater} 40{\%} of the hybrids stocked in 1981 and 1982 survived the first winter, and at least 19{\%} were alive in April 1985.

abstract = {Aquaponics is a form of aquaculture that integrates hydroponics to raise edible plants and fish. There is growing interest in aquaponics because it can be practiced in non-traditional locations for agriculture such as inside warehouses and on marginal lands, and it can provide locally grown products without using synthetic pesticides, chemical fertilizers, or antibiotics. Yet questions remain about the ecological and economic sustainability of aquaponics. The objective of this study was to describe the operating conditions, inputs (energy, water, and fish feed) and outputs (edible crops and fish) and their relationship over two years for a small-scale raft aquaponics operation in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. The system had roughly 1{\%} water loss per day and used an average of 35,950 L for replenishment per year. Predicted values suggest rainfall could completely replace the existing water needs. The average energy use was 19,526 kWh for propane and electricity per year at a cost of {\$}2055 US dollars. The largest uses of electricity were in-tank water heaters. Comparing inputs to outputs, 104 L of water, 0.5 kg feed, and 56 kWh energy ({\$}6 in energy costs) were needed to produce 1 kg of crops; and 292 L of water, 1.3 kg feed, and 159. kWh of energy ({\$}12 in energy costs) were needed to produce a 1 kg increase in tilapia. Raising tilapia was a net loss, while raising crops was a net gain when comparing market prices to energy costs. Understanding energy, water, and feed use in aquaponic systems is essential to inform farm business plans. These data can serve as a point of comparison to other small-scale aquaponic systems, and inform future work on life cycle assessments of aquaponics.},

Air exposure causes acute hypoxia and physical damage to the gill lamellae, resulting in physiological stress and physical damage that increases with air exposure duration. Air exposure duration is a relevant and easily quantified metric for both fishers and managers and can therefore provide a definitive benchmark for improving postrelease survival. Yet, fishers are rarely provided with specific recommendations other than simply to “minimize” air exposure. This is a subjective recommendation, potentially causing confusion and noncompliance. Here we discuss and summarize the literature regarding air exposure thresholds in both commercial and recreational fisheries, the factors influencing these thresholds, and identify knowledge gaps limiting our understanding of tolerance to air exposure in captured fish.},

Previous studies retaining angler-caught fish are useful in understanding delayed mortality but have associated limitations. As an alternative to tournament mortality studies, we estimated daily apparent survival rates of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides using a modified Cormack-Jolly-Seber model in Program MARK to test for the duration of delayed tournament mortality and to identify important covariates affecting survival. Multiple monotonic trends were evaluated to test acute (2, 3, 4, or 7 d) and chronic (15 or 30 d) delayed mortality hypotheses. The most supported models revealed an acute trend in survival following tournament capture but no support for chronic mortality. Largemouth bass survival decreased with increases in water temperature and the number of tournament capture events. Combined, these factors resulted in up to 90{\%} cumulative mortality at temperatures of 18.8 °C for individuals captured at five tournament events. Our results confirm the potential for high delayed mortality associated with catch and release fishing tournaments. Using mark-recapture data to understand tournament fishing mortality can be a valuable tool in managing highly fished systems.},

abstract = {Correspondence analysis was used to partition fish species associated with the open water of each of the five Great Lakes and nine coastal wetlands for which data were available. Included in the analysis were 113 species in 25 families. Three species complexes were suggested: a Great Lakes taxocene (31 species); a transitional community which utilized open water, nearshore, and wetlands (35 species); and a wetlands taxocene, comprised of 47 species found to be closely associated with coastal wetlands. The wetland species split into two main groups: permanent residents (e.g., brown bullhead Ictalurus nebulosus, mudminnow Umbra lima, longnose gar Lepisosteus osseus) and migratory species. Migratory species included three subgroups: (1) those that spawned in the wetlands and then left (e.g., northern pike Esox lucius, common carp Cyprinus carpio, white sucker Catostomus commersoni, walleye Stizostedion vitreum), (2) those that used the wetlands as a nursery area (e.g., northern pike, gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum, spottail shiner Notropis hudsonius), and (3) those that migrated into the wetland from other wetlands or a Great Lake for shelter, spawning sites, or food; as part of the sustaining process of dispersal of young; or as part of wandering behavior (e.g., burbot Lota lota, rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax, rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss). It was found that most remaining coastal wetlands are degraded or altered to some degree, and are dominated by a characteristic silt- and turbidity-tolerant fish fauna (e.g., common carp, gizzard shad, goldfish Carassius auratus, and brown bullhead). Nevertheless, even degraded wetlands still functioned as important fish habitat by exporting large quantities offish, first to avian, piscine, and mammalian food chains through predation, and second to the Great Lakes as young-of-the-year sport and forage fish. The research implies that a wetland must maintain a connection with a Great Lake to promote and enhance efficient fish utilization of the high productivity of marshes; that additional resilience is provided to species which spawn in wetlands since they can produce two cohorts (one in wetlands and one in the Great Lakes), and that fluctuating water levels are important in sustaining habitat diversity and productivity. {\textcopyright} 1992, International Association for Great Lakes Research.

abstract = {Many recreational anglers practice catch-and-release angling, where fish are returned to the water with the presumption that they will survive. However, not all fish survive, and those that do often experience sublethal consequences including injury and stress. There is compelling scientific evidence that angler behavior and gear choice can affect the success of catch-and-release as a management and conservation strategy. Because anglers often look to government natural resource agencies for guidance on how to handle and release fish properly, there is a need to assess whether their outreach materials are readily accessible and provide the necessary and correct information on the subject. Therefore, on-line catch-and-release guidelines developed by state and provincial natural resource agencies across North America were evaluated to determine whether their guidelines were consistent with the best available scientific information. This analysis revealed that there was immense variation in the depth and breadth of coverage among jurisdictions. Agency guidelines contradicted one another in several areas including air exposure, angling in deep water, venting trapped gases, and resuscitation. In many cases, the guidelines failed to provide sufficient direction to actually be of use to anglers or provide direction consistent with contemporary scientific literature. This analysis will assist with developing outreach materials that promote sustainable recreational fisheries and in maintaining the welfare status of individual fish. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Coastal wetlands in the Laurentian Great Lakes are critical habitats for supporting fish diversity and abundance within the basin. Insight into the coupling of biodiversity patterns with habitat conditions may elucidate mechanisms shaping diverse communities. Within coastal wetlands, water depth as well as fluctuations in lake-wide water levels over inter-annual timescales, both have the potential to influence fish communities. Water level fluctuation can influence fish habitat structure (e.g., vegetation) in Great Lakes coastal wetlands, but it is unclear how water depth and lake-wide water level fluctuations affect fish community composition and diversity. Using $\beta$ dissimilarity indices and multivariate ordination techniques, we assessed fish community structure among bulrush (Schoenoplectus acutus)-dominated wetlands in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron, USA. We examined whether community structure was related to wetland water depth at the time of sampling and whether fish communities were more similar among years with similar Lake Huron water levels. Results suggested relatively high levels of both spatial (among wetlands) and temporal (among year) community dissimilarity that was driven primarily by species turnover. Thus, variability in water depths among wetlands and in Lake Huron water levels among years likely both contribute to regional fish diversity. Further, fish abundance and alpha diversity were positively correlated with wetland water depth at the time of sampling. Both climate change and anthropogenic water level stabilization may alter the magnitude and timing of water level fluctuations in the Great Lakes. Our data suggest that these changes could affect local fish community composition and regional fish diversity.},

We determined the probability of tag loss for passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags implanted into dorsal muscu-lature, T-bar anchor tags attached to dorsal pterygiophores, and both tags in relation to years posttagging for double-marked adult muskellunge Esox masquinongy over a 10-year period. We also used PIT tags as a benchmark to assess the interactive effects of fish length at tagging, sex, and years posttagging on T-bar anchor tag loss rates. Only five instances of PIT tag loss were identified; the calculated probability of a fish's losing its PIT tag was consistently less than 1.0{\%} for up to 10 years posttagging. The probability of T-bar anchor tag loss by muskellunge was related to both the number of years posttagging and the total length (TL) of the fish at tagging. The T-bar anchor tag loss rate 1 year after tagging was 6.5{\%}. Individuals of less than 750 mm TL at tagging had an-chor tag loss rates less than 10{\%} for up to 6 years after tagging. However, the proportion of fish losing T-bar anchor tags steadily increased with increasing years posttagging (∼30{\%} after 6 years) for larger muskellunge. Fish gender did not influence the probabil-ity of T-bar anchor tag loss. Our results indicate that T-bar anchor tags are best suited for short-term applications (≤1 year) involving adult muskellunge. We recommend use of PIT tags for longer-term tagging studies, particularly for muskellunge larger than 750 mm TL. Tagging and marking techniques are frequently used in fisheries investigations to obtain information on population parameters, movement patterns, and individual growth and to distinguish different groups of fish (Guy et al. 1996). Choosing an appropriate tagging or marking technique is guided by several factors, including study design and objectives, cost,},

Given either astaxanthin or canthaxanthin in separate diets, at dietary levels of {\textless}30 mg kg-1, an identical linear relationship (R2 = 0.97) between dietary levels and blood concentrations was observed for both carotenoids. At dietary astaxanthin inclusions above 30 mg kg-1, blood astaxanthin concentration approached saturation at an average level of 1.2 ± 0.04 $\mu$g mL-1 (arithmetic mean ± SD), whereas blood levels of canthaxanthin continued to increase linearly throughout the inclusion range tested (0-60 mg kg-1). When both carotenoids were presented in the same diet, a reduction in the absorption efficiency of both pigments was observed (P {\textless} 0.05). This manifested itself as a lower level in blood than the level observed when each carotenoid was administered separately. The negative interaction was most prominent for astaxanthin, the maximum average blood saturation level of which fell (P {\textless} 0.05) to 0.73 ± 0.03 ng mL-1 (arithmetic mean ± SD). Our data support the conclusion that at higher dietary inclusions, canthaxanthin is more efficiently absorbed from the digestive tract into the blood of S. salar than astaxanthin.},

abstract = {Abstract: Commercially available electrosedation apparatuses (e.g., the Smith-Root Portable Electroanesthesia System [PES]) are growing in popularity within the fisheries research community. This technology can be used to immobilize fish rapidly and does not require a withdrawal period before fish are released. A number of studies examined how various settings (e.g., duration, frequency, voltage) influence the performance of the PES for fish sedation, but comparatively less is known about the role of fish orientation and position on the efficacy of electrosedation within the PES. We compared recovery times of Bluegill Lepomis macrochirus upon manipulation of three variables: orientation of fish, electric field size (i.e., spacing between the anode and cathode), and fish proximity relative to the anode. Fish were individually exposed to pulsed DC with a standardized frequency (100 Hz), voltage (90 V), and shock duration (3 s). Full recovery time was significantly longer for fish oriented at horizontal angles (0° and 180°) than at acute angles (45° and 135°). Significant interactions were found between orientation and electrode spacing, as well as between orientation and fish proximity. These findings are pertinent to researchers in the field looking to optimize recovery time for a quick release after surgery, tagging, or any other time fish sedation is required.

abstract = {Although much is known about the factors that influence the effects of catch-and-release angling on fish condition and survival, relatively little is known about the effects of fishing gear strength on fight time and, hence, fish condition. Moreover, little is known about how gear strength and fight time interact with air exposure duration to ultimately influence the level of exhaustion experienced by fish at time of release. Here we systematically varied fishing gear strength (ultralight versus medium-heavy) and air exposure duration (0 versus 120 s) when targeting Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides. We relied on reflex impairment (using five different reflexes) as a real-time indicator of fish condition. Largemouth Bass fight durations were highly variable between fishing gear types and across fish sizes. Largemouth Bass captured on ultralight fishing gear experienced longer fight times, and there was a stronger positive relationship between fish length and fight time than for those captured on heavier fishing gear. However, fish captured using ultralight gear were easier to handle upon landing and thus experienced shorter hook removal times, which may result in less air exposure in actual angling scenarios. Fish captured with ultralight gear had significantly higher reflex impairment than those captured with heavy gear with no air exposure, while fish captured with both gear types had similarly high reflex impairment when exposed to the air. These results indicate that gear strength does influence the level of exhaustion experienced by Largemouth Bass. However, fish that are landed quickly are so vigorous that handling and hook removal are challenging. We submit that there is likely a compromise where neither ultralight nor ultraheavy gear (always relative to the size and species targeted) is appropriate. Moreover, our findings emphasize the importance of minimizing air exposure, particularly for fish that are exhausted already from a protracted fight.

abstract = {Increases in catch-and-release practices in addition to angler engagement in management activities to evaluate and improve the trophy potential of Muskellunge Esox masquinongy fisheries have become prevalent in recent decades. An expectation of conservative angling practices and regulations is that released fish can be recaptured by anglers at a later time and potentially at a larger size. Although several studies have evaluated Muskellunge recapture rates, no studies have estimated the number of recaptured Muskellunge relative to the number present in the population. Additionally, few studies have evaluated angling size selectivity and the potential benefits or biases of incorporating those data into traditional Muskellunge assessments. This study evaluated the proportion of Muskellunge that were caught and recaptured relative to the population estimates in two Minnesota water bodies and the potential length-related bias from angler-caught fish. Data were obtained from traditional sampling gears (i.e., trap netting, boat electrofishing) and angling by volunteer anglers in the Mississippi and Crow Wing rivers and Baby and Man lakes. Participating anglers captured 11–22{\%} of the population, of which 1–3{\%} were subsequently recaptured at both sites annually. Recaptured fish accounted for 5–16{\%} of the annual catch. At the Mississippi River site, proportionally larger fish were angled compared with the modeled population size structure, whereas angler catch from Baby and Man lakes was similar to the modeled size structure, likely due to the differing techniques used by anglers in the two water bodies. A more thorough understanding of recapture rates and size selectivity may be particularly important when managing a low-density species as angling pressure and angler involvement in management activities increase.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of repeated monthly use of pulsed-DC electrofishing on condition factor (K), instantaneous growth rate (G), and movement of stream-dwelling creek chub Semotilus atromaculatus, white suckers Catostomus commersonii, and green sunfish Lepomis cyanellus. Fish that were captured five or more times by approximately monthly electrofishing were compared with control groups. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) models indicated that repeated electroshocking had such a minute impact (0.2{\%} reduction in error sum of squares) on K that this effect was unlikely to be biologically meaningful, especially given that it was positive for white suckers. Similar models for G showed small but statistically significant decreases in white sucker and creek chub G-values from repeated monthly electroshocking; there was no effect for green sunfish. An additional model analyzing the impact of repeated electroshocking of white suckers at bimonthly intervals showed no significant effect on G. For all three species, the relative frequency of remaining stationary or exhibiting net movement upstream or downstream was similar between repeatedly electroshocked fish and control fish, as were the net distances moved in either direction. Thus, monthly applications of electrofishing had minimal negative effects on K for only two of the three species; slightly larger negative effects on G for only two species; and no measurable effects on movement of any species. In contrast to the effect of monthly electroshocking, bimonthly exposures did not negatively affect G for white suckers. Overall, the results suggest that pulsed-DC electrofishing (60 Hz; 36{\%} duty cycle) is a safe methodological tool for studying these species, provided it is not used too frequently.},

abstract = {Management agencies have increasingly relied on size limits, daily bag or trip limits, quotas, and seasonal closures to manage fishing in recreational and commercial fisheries. Another trend is to establish aquatic protected areas, including no-take reserves (NTRs), to promote sustainable fisheries and protect aquatic ecosystems. Some anglers, assuming that no serious harm befalls the fish, advocate allowing catch-and-release (C{\&}R) angling in aquatic protected areas. The ultimate success of these regulations and C{\&}R angling depends on ensuring high release survival rates by minimizing injury and mortality. To evaluate the potential effectiveness of these practices, we review trends in C{\&}R fishing and factors that influence release mortality. Analysis of Marine Recreational Fishery Statistic Survey (MRFSS) data for 1981-1999 showed no statistically significant U.S. trends for total number of anglers (mean 7.7 × 106), total catch in numbers (mean 362 × 106), or total annual catch/angler (mean 42.6 fish). However, mean total annual landings declined 28{\%} (188.5 to 135.7 × 106), mean total catch/angler/trip declined 22.1{\%} (0.95 to 0.74 fish), and mean landings/angler/trip declined 27{\%} (0.42 to 0.31 fish). The total number of recreational releases or discards increased 97.1{\%} (98.0 to 193.2 × 106) and as a proportion of total catch from 34.2{\%} in 1981 to 58.0{\%} in 1999. Evidence indicates that the increased releases and discards are primarily in response to mandatory regulations and to a lesser extent, voluntary releases. Total annual catch and mean annual catch/angler were maintained despite declines in catch per trip because anglers took 30.8{\%} more fishing trips (43.5 to 56.9 × 106), perhaps to compensate for greater use of bag and size limits. We reviewed 53 release mortality studies, doubling the number of estimates since Muoneke and Childress (1994) reviewed catch and release fishing. A meta-analysis of combined data (n=274) showed a skewed distribution of release mortality (median 11{\%}, mean 18{\%}, range 0-95{\%}). Mortality distributions were similar for salmonids, marine, and freshwater species. Mean mortality varied greatly by species and within species, anatomical hooking location was the most important mortality factor. Other significant mortality factors were: use of natural bait, removing hooks from deeply hooked fish, use of J-hooks (vs. circle hooks), deeper depth of capture, warm water temperatures, and extended playing and handling times. Barbed hooks had marginally higher mortality than barbless hooks. Based on numbers of estimates, no statistically significant overall effects were found for fish size, hook size, venting to deflate fish caught at depth, or use of treble vs. single hooks. Catch and release fishing is a growing and an increasingly important activity. The common occurrence of release mortality, however, requires careful evaluation for achieving fishery management goals and in some cases, disturbance, injury, or mortality may conflict with some goals of NTRs. Research is needed to develop better technology and techniques to reduce release mortality, to assess mortality from predation during capture and after release, to determine cumulative mortality from multiple hooking and release events, and to measure sub-lethal effects on behavior, physical condition, growth, and reproduction. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.},

abstract = {Fisheries worldwide are subject to economic mismanagement of major proportions. Although most commercial fish stocks are capable of yielding high net profits (rents), only a relatively few fisheries are actually profitable. Rough estimates suggest that on a global scale, the loss of net economic benefits due to mismanagement of fisheries may easily amount to 50{\%} or more of the global landed value of some 100 billion US{\$} annually. The fisheries problem derives fundamentally from inappropriate social institutions controlling the fishing activity, the foremost of which is the common property arrangement. Fisheries management consists of replacing these institutions with more appropriate ones and, within that framework, setting the correct parameters over time. Global evidence suggests that the cost of fisheries management often constitutes a substantial fraction of the value of the harvest. A part of the fisheries management problem, therefore, is to strike the right balance between the efficacy of the fisheries management regime and the cost of operating it. The problem of fisheries management is by its nature multi-disciplinary. It involves marine ecology and biology, mathematics, economics, game theory, political science and anthropology to name a few. The problem is, moreover, typically quite complex, requiring powerful modelling and calculation techniques. In many respects, this is the kind of problem operations research techniques are designed to deal with.},

abstract = {We simulated and evaluated multistate capture–recapture models to estimate mortality rates using telemetry data. Four field designs were considered: (A) fixed receivers to estimate total instantaneous mortality (Z), (B) manual searches to estimate instantaneous fishing (F) and natural (M) mortality, (C) fixed receivers combined with external high-reward tags to estimate F and M, and (D) manual searches combined with external high-reward tags to estimate M and fishing mortality rates associated with harvest (F h ) and catch-and-release death (F cr ) as well as the probability of death due to catch and release ($\alpha$). Estimates generally appeared to be unbiased for a simulated study with five periods and releases of telemetered fish at the start of periods 1–4. Compared to estimating Z, larger sample sizes are needed to achieve reliable estimates of component rates (F and M). Estimates of component rates were more precise when that source of mortality was directly observed (M in design B, F in design C). The field design using fixed receivers and high-reward tags should be especially useful in practice, because manual searches are not required to estimate F and M. Multistate models are useful for clarifying the connection between field observations and ecological processes. Reliable estimates of mortality rates, coupled with information on behavior, habitat use, and movement, make telemetry a highly valuable tool for improving fisheries management and stock assessment.},

We quantified critical thermal maxima (CTMaxima) and minima (CTMinima) of Atlantic stingrays from St. Joseph's Bay, Florida. Spiracle contraction cessation for more than one minute was the experimental endpoint. Laboratory-acclimated fish held at 10.8, 20.5, or 35.1 C exhibited CTMaxima of 35.7, 39.3, or 43.2 C, and CTMinima of 0.8, 4.8, or 10.8 C, respectively. Regression analysis revealed that CTMaxima increased by 0.31 C and CTMinima decreased by 0.41 C for every 1.0 C increase in acclimation temperature. Atlantic stingrays exposed to diel thermoperiods of 34.0-37.3 C and 7.0-11.0 C had CTMaxima of 43.1 and 33.4 C and CTMinima of 9.6 and 0.3 C, respectively, suggesting that fish acclimated to low cycle temperatures. A thermal tolerance polygon produced from laboratory data had an area of 978 C2, the third largest ever measured in a fish. Seasonally acclimatized fish achieved their lowest respective CTMaxima and CTMinima of 37.3 and 2.5 C in March and highest values of 41.8 and 6.6 C during July. Low extreme temperatures in St. Joseph's Bay came within 0.3 C of the fishes' CTMin; however, extreme high temperatures came no closer than 6.5 C of the fishes' CTMax.

abstract = {Recreational freshwater fisheries are key components of local economies in many regions. The quality of these fisheries can be affected not only by harvest but also by catch-and-release practices. Documenting catch and release among sport fish taxa is, therefore, important to fisheries researchers studying sport fishes and managers regulating these fisheries. We used an angler diary survey to assess taxon-specific effort, catch, harvest, release, and reason for release during the 2011 open-water season. Our study included information on 5,007 fishing trips taken by 652 anglers. These anglers visited 279 lakes spanning 11,761.5 km2 of northern Wisconsin. Muskellunge Esox masquinongy, black bass (i.e., Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu and Largemouth Bass M. salmoides), Northern Pike E. lucius, Walleye Sander vitreus, and panfish were released at rates of 99, 97, 86, 67, and 67{\%}, respectively, when targeted by anglers. This study is the first to document black bass catch-and-release rates in the region and corroborates previous findings of Muskellunge and Walleye catch-and-release rates based on creel surveys. Voluntary catch and release was the most common reason for release. Our findings suggest that regulations may be much more generous than the harvest rates practiced by anglers and that catch-and-release angling practices may be an important factor affecting these sport fish populations.

However the pharmacological properties, safety and often efficacy of local anesthetic drugs have not been investigated yet in fish, amphibians, or reptiles. This review compiled current information concerning the use of those agents in fish, reptiles and amphibians to help clinicians make an informed decision as to which dose and drug to use. The resulting literature search showed that the literature concerning use of local analgesics in fish and amphibians is very limited while the literature for reptiles is more extensive. We found few experimental studies evaluating the efficacy of local anesthetics.

abstract = {Conservation of genetic resources is a challenging issue for agencies managing popular sport fishes. To address the ongoing potential for genetic risks, we developed a comprehensive set of recommendations to conserve genetic diversity of muskellunge (Esox masquinongy) in Wisconsin, and evaluated the extent to which the recommendations can be implemented. Although some details are specific to Wisconsin's muskellunge propagation program, many of the practical issues affecting implementation are applicable to other species and production systems. We developed guidelines to restrict future broodstock collection operations to lakes with natural reproduction and to develop a set of brood lakes to use on a rotational basis within regional stock boundaries, but implementation will require considering lakes with variable stocking histories. Maintaining an effective population size sufficient to minimize the risk of losing alleles requires limiting broodstock collection to large lakes. Recommendations to better approximate the temporal distribution of spawning in hatchery operations and randomize selection of brood fish are feasible. Guidelines to modify rearing and distribution procedures face some logistic constraints. An evaluation of genetic diversity of hatchery-produced fish during 2008 demonstrated variable success representing genetic variation of the source population. Continued evaluation of hatchery operations will optimize operational efficiency while moving toward genetic conservation goals.

abstract = {Length-limit regulations and promotion of catch-and-release fishing have become increasingly important management approaches for recreational fisheries. We review studies on catch-and-release (hooking) mortality gathered from the existing fisheries literature and from a survey of fisheries management agencies in all 50 states, the U.S. government, all Canadian provinces, and selected academic and research institutions. We identified hooking mortality estimates for 32 taxa. Most studies dealt with salmonids, centrarchids (especially black basses, Microptemsspp.), and percids (especially walleye, Stizostedion vitreum). Within and among species, differences in percent mortality were reported in association with bait type (artificial vs. natural), hook type (number of hooks, hook size, and barbs), season/ temperature, water depth (depressurization), anatomical location of hook wound, and individual size. Although most hooking mortalities occur within 24 h, the use of initial plus delayed mortality provides a more complete estimate of mortality. Single hooks (especially when used in conjunction with natural baits) resulted in higher mortalities than treble hooks. Environmental conditions (notably high water temperature and low dissolved oxygen) are important to overall mortality related to hooking, playing, and handling. Mortalities were highly variable; occasionally exceeding 30{\%} among red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), smallmouth bass (M. dolomieu), largemouth bass (M. salmoides), cutthroat trout (Oncorbyncbus clarki), and catfishes (Ictaluridae), and 68{\%} among spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus), bluegills (Lepomis macrocbirus), crappies, (Pomoxis spp.), striped bass (Morone saxatilis), and coho salmon (O. kisutcb). Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycusb) and pikes (Esocidae) had mortalities under 15{\%}. The many variables potentially affecting hooking mortality may make optimal management of particular species and water bodies difficult using regional-level (e.g., statewide) management regulations. {\textcopyright} 1994, Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.

However, we contend that the recreational fishing sector also has the potential to negatively affect fish and fisheries. Here we present evidence to show that both recreational and commercial fishing sectors deserve consideration as contributors to the exploitation of fish in marine and inland waters. The lack of global monitoring and compiling of statistics on recreational fishing participation, harvest, and catch-and-release has retarded our ability to understand the magnitude of this fishing sector. Using data from Canada, we estimate that the potential contribution of recreational fish harvest around the world may represent approximately 12 percent of the global fish harvest. Failure to recognize the potential contribution of recreational fishing to fishery declines, environmental degradation, and ecosystem alterations places ecologically and economically important resources at risk. Elevating recreational fishing to a global conservation concern would facilitate the development of strategies to increase the sustainability of this activity.},

Carbon dioxide may be used as an immediate-release sedative, but it is slow-acting and difficult to apply uniformly and effectively. Tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222) is easier to apply but requires a 21-d withdrawal period. The lack of an immediate-release sedative approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration(FDA) is a consequence of numerous factors, including the complexities of the approval process, the substantial human and monetary resources involved, and the specialized nature of the work. Efforts are currently underway to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of benzocaine- and eugenol-based products as immediate-release sedatives. However, pursuing approvals within thecurrent framework will consume an exorbitant amount of public and private resources and will take years to complete, even though both compounds are “generally recognized as safe” for certain applications by the FDA. We recommend using risk management–based approaches to increase the efficiencyof the drug approval process and the availability of safe and effective drugs, including immediate-release sedatives, for use in the fisheries and aquaculture disciplines. {\textcopyright} 2013 Taylor  {\&}  Francis Group, LLC.},

We tested the impacts of fin clipping, PIT tags, and three external tags (T-bar anchor, opercular, and streamer tags) on age-0 Northern Pike in a pond. We also examined the impacts of surgically implanted transmitters on small adult Northern Pike in a natural lake. The loss of PIT tags was lowest among all tags and close to 0{\%}. Of the external tags, T-bar anchor tags performed best. Loss of these tags was initially low (on average 5.7{\%} after 195 d) increasing to about 20.0{\%} by 520 d posttagging. Tagging-induced mortality of a few percent was present in all tags tested within the first 195 d posttagging in the pond environment but not present afterwards. The PIT tags, fin clips, and external tags did not affect the growth or condition of surviving fish. Surgically implanted transmitters reduced the growth of small adult Northern Pike with total lengths  {\textless} 480 mm, but no effects were found for larger individuals. We conclude that PIT tagging is the most suitable marking technique for age-0 Northern Pike. If external visibility is required, T-bar anchor tags are also useful, as long as tagging-induced mortality and tag loss rates are accounted for at the analysis stage. Our study raises a cautionary note about surgically implanted transmitters in small adult Northern Pike, as they may negatively affect behavior and fitness.Received March 27, 2013; accepted November 26, 2013. {\textcopyright} 2014 {\textcopyright} American Fisheries Society 2014.},

abstract = {Fish sedation facilitates safer handling of fish during scientific research or fisheries assessment practices, thus limiting risk of injury to fish and reducing stress responses. In recent years, there has been growing interest in using electricity to sedate fish; two methods include (1) lower-voltage, non-pulsed-DC fish handling gloves (FHGs) that tend to only sedate fish while the gloves are touching the animal; and (2) a comparatively high-voltage, pulsed-DC Portable Electrosedation System (PES) that leads to galvanonarcosis. This study compared the physiological consequences of exposure to FHGs and PES in teleost fish. Bluegills Lepomis macrochirus and Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides were exposed to FHGs, PES, or a handling control for a 3-min simulated surgery. Blood was then sampled at 0.5 and 4.5 h postexposure and was analyzed for blood glucose, blood lactate, and plasma cortisol concentrations. Opercular rates were monitored during surgery, at 2 min postsurgery, and 0.5 h postsurgery. At 24 h postsurgery, time to exhaustion (via a standardized swimming chase protocol) was assessed. Fish exposed to FHGs tended to exhibit lower opercular rates than fish that were sedated with the PES during simulated surgery. Cortisol levels of Largemouth Bass treated with FHGs were higher than those of fish sedated with the PES. Glucose levels recorded for Bluegills at 4.5 h postsurgery were higher with FHGs than with the PES. In both species, lactate was lower for fish treated with FHGs than for those treated with the PES. At 24 h posttreatment, Bluegills sedated with FHGs exhibited a longer time to exhaustion than those subjected to the PES, whereas Largemouth Bass sedated with the PES exhibited a longer time to exhaustion than those sedated with FHGs. Physiological responses to treatments were inconsistent between species. Further investigation to determine the optimal electrosedation method is required.},

However, little is known about the effects of minimum length limits on populations of muskellunge Esox masquinongy. We monitored changes in the muskellunge population in Bone Lake, a 1,781-acre lake in northwest Wisconsin over a 31-year period (1964-1995) during which time length limits were changed from 30 in to 34 in and from 34 in to 40 in. These changes were compared with population changes in nearby Deer Lake (807 acres), where the length limit remained at the statewide minimum of 32 in. Mean length of adult muskellunge in Bone Lake increased from 31.3 in in 1964 to 36.0 in in 1995. Adult (30-in) muskellunge abundance in Bone Lake increased more than five-fold during the study and reached a density of 0.99 fish/acre. Abundance of larger (38-in) muskellunge increased 269{\%} following minimum length limit increases between 1982 and 1995. Relative weight (W sub(r)) of Bone Lake muskellunge decreased during the study, suggesting intraspecific competition for food resources. The muskellunge population in Deer Lake also had positive increases in size structure, but the increases were not as great as those in Bone Lake, and population abundance did not change. Results from this study suggest that high minimum length limits can increase abundance and mean length of a muskellunge population, but biologists need to consider long-term effects on the fish community if high densities are achieved.},

abstract = {Understanding the genetic and evolutionary impacts of stocking on wild fish populations has long been of interest as negative consequences such as reduced fitness and loss of genetic diversity are commonly reported outcomes. In an attempt to sustain a fishery, managers implemented nearly five decades of extensive stocking of over a million Muskellunge (Esox masquinongy), a native species in the Lower St. Lawrence River (Quebec, Canada). We investigated the effect of this stocking on population genetic structure and allelic diversity in the St. Lawrence River in addition to tributaries and several stocked inland lakes. Using genotype by sequencing, we genotyped 643 individuals representing 22 locations and combined this information with forward simulations to investigate the genetic consequences of long-term stocking. Individuals native to the St. Lawrence watershed were genetically differentiated from stocking sources and tributaries, and inland lakes were naturally differentiated from the main river. Empirical data and simulations within the St. Lawrence River revealed weak stocking effects on admixture patterns. Our data suggest that the genetic structure associated with stocked fish was diluted into its relatively large effective population size. This interpretation is also consistent with a hypothesis that selection against introgression was in operation and relatively efficient within the large St. Lawrence River system. In contrast, smaller populations from adjacent tributaries and lakes displayed greater stocking-related admixture that resulted in comparatively higher heterozygosity than the St. Lawrence. Finally, individuals from inland lakes that were established by stocking maintained a close affinity with their source populations. This study illustrated a benefit of combining extensive genomic data with forward simulations for improved inference regarding population-level genetic effects of long-term stocking, and its relevance for fishery management decision making.},

Estimated initial mortalities for the three tournaments were high - 48{\%}, 34{\%}, and 80{\%} - perhaps because the lake temperature exceeded 20 degree C. Estimated delayed mortalities (within 1 week of release of tagged fish) were 18{\%}, 9{\%}, and 0{\%}. Estimated tournament-related long-term mortalities, based on tag return rates during the ensuing year, were 1{\%}, 2{\%}, and 0{\%} of the total catch for each tournament. Comparison of the estimated harvest for tournament and nontournament anglers for the month of tournament activity indicated that the tournaments accounted for up to 25{\%} of the estimated total harvest of walleyes in June. Tournament mortality might be reduced by holding tournaments when water is cool, by limiting stress on fish (e.g., by requiring aeration of live wells and holding tanks and by avoiding large temperature changes), and by limiting catch (e.g., by restricting creel limits, fishing time, and angler participation; by increasing size limits; and by establishing a "catch-measure-release" procedure).},

abstract = {—Management agencies commonly use high minimum length limits for muskellunge Esox masquinongy to achieve the goal of trophy fisheries. Evaluations of length-limit effects on muskellunge populations have been limited. We evaluated the effects of a 40-in minimum length limit (total length) on seven northern Wisconsin lakes and compared the results to eight lakes that remained at the statewide minimum length limit of 32 or 34 in. Five years after its implementation, the 40-in minimum length limit did not increase adult muskellunge abundance or size structure compared with reference lakes. Variation among lakes dictates that low-density species such as muskellunge be monitored for extended periods and that reference waters also be monitored to aid interpretation of data and development of meaningful management recommendations. Management strategies for muskellunge Esox masquinongy are most often directed toward es-tablishing trophy fisheries (Hanson et al. 1986; Wingate 1986), and management agencies have used a variety of length, bag, and season limits to develop and maintain trophy muskellunge fisher-ies. However, the term trophy has been difficult to define. Angler definitions of trophy size may range from less than 30 in to more than 50 in, based largely on angler experience (all lengths herein are total lengths). Margenau et al. (1994) quantified the definition of a trophy muskellunge from an opinion survey for anglers who fish muskellunge in Wisconsin. Most anglers (98{\%}) surveyed be-lieved that a muskellunge needed to be at least 40 in to be a trophy, 50 in being the most common response (36{\%}). Using information such as that provided by the angler survey, Wisconsin estab-lished, between 1990 and 1992, a 40-in minimum length limit for muskellunge in approximately 50 waters. Evaluations of length limits for muskellunge are limited. This paucity of information is due, in part, to the naturally low density of adult muskellunge, which makes sampling and biological interpreta-tion of results difficult (Hanson et al. 1986). Using information obtained from angler diaries, Mac-Lennan (1996) declared that implementation of a 40-in length limit was successful in Lake St. Clair;},

Experimental populations included muskellunge from the Upper Mississippi (Leech Lake, MN, USA) and Ohio (Cave Run Lake, KY, USA) river drainages, as well as progeny from North Spring Lake, IL, a mixed-origin stock. No differences in hourly movement rates or home ranges were detected among stocks. Movement rates were greatest during spring (mean ± SE = 42 ± 4 m h)1), lowest during summer (16 ± 3 m h)1) and intermediate in autumn (28 ± 5 m h)1). Additionally, movement rates during the summer were greater at night than crepuscular periods. Home range sizes were similar during spring and autumn (mean ± SE = 17–18 ± 3–4 ha) and decreased during summer (5 ± 3 ha). Although habitat selection charac- teristics were generally similar among stocks, fish from the Upper Mississippi River drainage occupied deeper water more frequently and selected the pelagic zone more strongly during the spring than those from the Ohio River and mixed-origin stocks. Within the littoral zone, muskellunge selected coarse woody habitat and aquatic macrophytes. Collectively, these findings suggest little behavioural differentiation among genetically divergent stocks when evaluated in a common reservoir environment.},

Peak movements and activities occurred in spring and fall when water temperatures were 4-l2°C. During the summer months tagged fish occupied waters less than 2 m in depth at temperatures of 24-27°C. Greatest average swimming velocity of muskellunge observed was 50.8 m/minute. During winter months a tagged fish moved out of waters with low oxygen levels in the north bay of Black Lake to areas with a more abundant supply of oxygen. The monthly home range size of the muskellunge varied from 0.2 to 2.7 ha in Black Lake and from 2.3 to 27.7 ha in Moose Lake. Four spawning areas were identified and spawning activities were observed. Muskellunge moved onto spawning grounds when water temperatures reached 8-l0°C and remained on spawning grounds until temperatures reached about l4°C.

Although movements consistent with reproductive homing have been documented for muskellunge Esox masquinongy in relatively large, complex systems, quantitative data describing their distribution at the restricted spatial scale relevant to small lake fisheries are lacking. We sampled muskellunge by means of fyke netting over 2 years in each of four Wisconsin lakes with surface areas between 110 and 588 ha. Individual capture locations were recorded. Each muskellunge sampled during the first year was injected with a passive integrated transponder to allow identification of the individuals recaptured during the second year. The number of recaptures with functional transponders during the second year ranged from 15 to 43 per lake. Capture site fidelity, defined as the percentage of recaptured fish being found in the same spawning area in two consecutive years, varied from 55{\%} to 93{\%}. The results are relevant to population estimation and broodstock collection for artificial propagation. Population estimates need to include all spawning habitats because marked and unmarked fish are not well mixed throughout the lake during the spawning season. Because repeated netting effort at the same locations among years is likely to resample individuals used for broodstock collection, netting effort should be dispersed among spawning sites. {\textcopyright} American Fisheries Society 2011.},

abstract = {The intracoelomic surgical implantation of electronic tags (including radio and acoustic telemetry transmitters, passive integrated transponders and archival biologgers) is frequently used for conducting studies on fish. Electronic tagging studies provide information on the spatial ecology, behavior and survival of fish in marine and freshwater systems. However, any surgical procedure, particularly one where a laparotomy is performed and the coelomic cavity is opened, has the potential to alter the survival, behavior or condition of the animal which can impair welfare and introduce bias. Given that management, regulatory and conservation decisions are based on the assumption that fish implanted with electronic tags have similar fates and behavior relative to untagged conspecifics, it is critical to ensure that best surgical practices are being used. Also, the current lack of standardized surgical procedures and reporting of specific methodological details precludes cross-study and cross-year analyses which would further progress the field of fisheries science. This compilation of papers seeks to identify the best practices for the entire intracoelomic tagging procedure including pre- and post-operative care, anesthesia, wound closure, and use of antibiotics. Although there is a particular focus on salmonid smolts given the large body of literature available on that group, other life-stages and species of fish are discussed where there is sufficient knowledge. Additional papers explore the role of the veterinarian in fish surgeries, the need for minimal standards in the training of fish surgeons, providing a call for more complete and transparent procedures, and identifying trends in procedures and research needs. Collectively, this body of knowledge should help to improve data quality (including comparability and repeatability), enhance management and conservation strategies, and maintain the welfare status of tagged fish. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

In experiment 2, 20 larger fish (342-405 mm TL; 520-844 g) were implanted with Sonotronics IBT-96-5 ultrasonic tags (36 × 11 mm; weight in air, 9.1 g; weight in water, 4.1 g). The tag burdens for all implanted fish ranged from 1.1{\%} to 3.4{\%}, and fish in both studies were held at 10-15°C. At the conclusion of both experiments (65 d after surgery), no mortalities were observed in any of the 60 tagged fish, most incisions were completely healed, and all fish in both experiments grew in length, although tagged fish grew more slowly than control fish in experiment 1. In both experiments, fish sutured with silk expelled tags more frequently than those sutured with Monocryl. Expulsion was observed in 45-50{\%} of the fish sutured with silk and 0-25{\%} of the fish sutured withMonocryl. Tag expulsion was not observed until 25-35 d after surgery. Fish sutured with silk exhibited a more severe inflammatory response 3 weeks after surgery than those sutured with Monocryl. In experiment 1, the rate of expulsion was linked to the severity of inflammation. Although braided silk sutures were applied faster than Moncryl sutures in both experiments, knots tied with either material were equally reliable and fish sutured with Monocryl experienced less inflammation and lower rates of tag expulsion.

abstract = {Extinction risks are increasing for amphibians due to rising threats and minimal conservation efforts. Nearly one quarter of all threatened/extinct amphibians in the IUCN Red List is purportedly at risk from the disease chytridiomycosis. However, a closer look at the data reveals that Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (the causal agent) has been identified and confirmed to cause clinical disease in only 14{\%} of these species. Primary literature surveys confirm these findings; ruling out major discrepancies between Red List assessments and real-time science. Despite widespread interest in chytridiomycosis, little progress has been made between assessment years to acquire evidence for the role of chytridiomycosis in species-specific amphibian declines. Instead, assessment teams invoke the precautionary principle when listing chytridiomycosis as a threat. Precaution is valuable when dealing with the world's most threatened taxa, however scientific research is needed to distinguish between real and predicted threats in order to better prioritize conservation efforts. Fast paced, cost effective, in situ research to confirm or rule out chytridiomycosis in species currently hypothesized to be threatened by the disease would be a step in the right direction. Ultimately, determining the manner in which amphibian conservation resources are utilized is a conversation for the greater conservation community that we hope to stimulate here.},

An individual-based simulation model was used to quantify the effect of harvest mortality at currently observed levels of recreational angling and tribal spearing fishery exploitation, along with simulated increases in exploitation, for three typical growth potentials (i.e., low, moderate, and high) of Muskellunge in northern Wisconsin across a variety of minimum length limits (i.e., 71, 102, 114, and 127 cm). Populations with moderate to high growth potential and minimum length limits ≥ 114 cm were predicted to have lower declines in numbers of trophy Muskellunge when subjected to angling-only and mixed fisheries at observed and increased levels of exploitation, which suggested that fisheries with disparate motivations may be able to coexist under certain conditions such as restrictive length limits and low levels of exploitation. However, for most Muskellunge populations in northern Wisconsin regulated by a 102-cm minimum length limit, both angling and spearing fisheries may reduce numbers of trophy Muskellunge as larger declines were predicted across all growth potentials. Our results may be useful if Muskellunge management options in northern Wisconsin are re-examined in the future.},

abstract = {Temperature is the primary environmental factor affecting physiological processes in ectotherms. Heat-Transfermodels describe how the fish's internal temperature responds to a fluctuating thermal environment. Specifically, the rate coefficient (k), defined as the instantaneous rate of change in body temperature in relation to the difference between ambient and body temperature, summarizes the combined effects of direct thermal conduction through body mass, passive convection (intracellular and intercellular fluids) and forced convective heat transfer (cardiovascular system). The k-coefficient is widely used in fish ecology to understand howbody temperature responds to changes in water temperature. The main objective of this study was to estimate the k-coefficient of brook charr equipped with internal temperaturesensitive transmitters in controlled laboratory experiments. Fish were first transferred from acclimation tanks (10°C) to tanks at 14, 19 or 23°C (warming experiments) and were then returned to the acclimation tanks (10°C; cooling experiments), thus producing six step changes in ambient temperature. We used non-linear mixed models to estimate the k-coefficient. Model comparisons indicated that the model incorporating the k-coefficient as a function of absolute temperature difference (dT: 4, 9 and 13°C) best described body temperature change. By simulating body temperature in a heterogeneous thermal environment, we provide theoretical predictions of maximum excursion duration between feeding and resting areas. Our simulations suggest that short (i.e. {\textless}60 min) excursions could be a common thermoregulatory behaviour adopted by cold freshwater fish species to sustain body temperature below a critical temperature threshold, enabling them to exploit resources in an unfavourable thermal environment.},

abstract = {Mortality associated with catch-and-release (C{\&}R) fisheries is typically estimated as a single value associated with fish that are immediately released after capture. However, with the widespread use of smartphones by anglers, memorable or rare fish may be subjected to prolonged handling time for photographs and measurements, resulting in increased air exposure and subsequent increased potential for post-release mortality. In situations of overfishing, large fish become rarer and their memorable status may increase. This may create a depensatory cycle of additional handling and mortality. The combination of mortality from prolonged handling, immediate release, and illegal harvest is a cumulative C{\&}R-related cryptic mortality that may have population-level effects in high-effort sport fisheries. We investigated the potential post-release mortality of memorable-sized (average length of 60 cm) bull trout after simulating prolonged handling (involving photographing and measuring) and immediate release in a controlled angling study at a remote Albertan lake during summer. We found that handling time and air exposure of large bull trout subjected to photography and measurement was long (112 s) and associated post-release mortality was high (10 dead / 30 fish; 33 {\%} after 24 h observation). Immediate release mortality was also high (3 dead / 20 fish; 15 {\%}). These levels of mortality, combined with high angler effort, can potentially lead to population-scale declines at C{\&}R fisheries. The complexity and difficulty of population-scale and field-level measurements of cryptic mortality suggest that adaptive management experiments in reductions in angling effort and improved fish handling may be effective in increasing understanding of sustainable angling.},

abstract = {Despite the routine nature of estimating overlapping space use in ecological research, to date no formal inferential framework for home range overlap has been available to ecologists. Part of this issue is due to the inherent difficulty of comparing the estimated home ranges that underpin overlap across individuals, studies, sites, species, and times. As overlap is calculated conditionally on a pair of home range estimates, biases in these estimates will propagate into biases in overlap estimates. Further compounding the issue of comparability in home range estimators is the historical lack of confidence intervals on overlap estimates. This means that it is not currently possible to determine if a set of overlap values is statistically different from one another. As a solution, we develop the first rigorous inferential framework for home range overlap. Our framework is based on the autocorrelated-Kernel density estimation (AKDE) family of home range estimators, which correct for biases due to autocorrelation, small effective sample size, and irregular sampling in time. Collectively, these advances allow AKDE estimates to validly be compared even when sampling strategies differ. We then couple the AKDE estimates with a novel bias-corrected Bhattacharyya coefficient (BC) to quantify overlap. Finally, we propagate uncertainty in the AKDE estimates through to overlap and thus are able to put confidence intervals on the BC point estimate. Using simulated data, we demonstrate how our inferential framework provides accurate overlap estimates, and reasonable coverage of the true overlap, even at small sample sizes. When applied to empirical data, we found that building an interaction network for Mongolian gazelles Procapra gutturosa based on all possible ties, vs. only those ties with statistical support, substantially influenced the network's properties and any potential biological inferences derived from it. Our inferential framework permits researchers to calculate overlap estimates that can validly be compared across studies, sites, species, and times, and test whether observed differences are statistically meaningful. This method is available via the R package ctmm.},

This paper documents poststocking dispersal and subsequent movement, habitat selection, behavior, and survival of fall stocked young-of-the-year muskellunge (12.1-13.1 in total length) with the objective of providing insights into the mechanism controlling short-term survival. Radio transmitters were surgically implanted into 27 muskellunge that were then stocked with untagged muskellunge into two northern Wisconsin lakes and monitored for 34 d. Most dispersal from stocking locations occurred within 2 weeks after stocking. Muskellunge selected inshore areas generally less than 10 ft deep. Emersed vegetation, particularly bulrushes Scirpus spp., submersed vegetation, and the trunks and branches of downed trees were preferred cover. The first day following stocking, muskellunge appeared stressed, failing to demonstrate an escape response when approached. Survival of both transmitter-tagged and untagged muskellunge in these stockings was higher than in previous investigations; presumably this was related to the large size of fish at stocking. Results of this study should aid habitat management and the design of future studies of ways to minimize poststocking mortality of muskellunge.},

Benthic sediments and fish taken in the vicinity of inactive industrial sites were found to contain elevated concentrations of Pb, Zn, Cu, and Cd. Concentrations of Pb and Zn in fillets of suckers and sunfish, as well as in whole bodies of sunfish, correlate well with metal concentrations observed in surficial sediments. The results of analyses provide valuable quantitative information regarding specific sources, current levels of contamination, potential risk to public health, and will allow more accurate assessment of continuing remediation efforts. {\textcopyright} 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. The trade-off between remaining stationary and being active has consequences for the survival and growth of fishes. Recent advancements in telemetry tools have enabled researchers to assess activity patterns of free-swimming fishes using tri-axial acceleration-sensing acoustic transmitters. This study describes the summer activity patterns of muskellunge (Esox masquinongy) in an 8 km reach of the Rideau River, Ontario between 1 June and 20 August 2010. Acceleration measurements indicated that muskellunge tended to remain inactive for much of the time. The effect of time of day (i.e., diel patterns), water temperature, and fish size were also examined. Activity was lowest at dawn, increased throughout the day, peaked at dusk, and declined at night. Activity also declined above temperatures of 25 °C and was lower for larger muskellunge. A comparison of fish captured with rod and reel versus boat electrofisher failed to reveal a significant difference in behaviour. The results of this study illustrate the utility of accelerometer transmitters for studying the behavioural ecology of free-swimming fishes. The results also confirm that muskellunge are generally sedentary during the summer period, but do exhibit reasonably pronounced diel activity patterns.},

abstract = {The trophy fisheries for Muskellunge Esox masquinongy in the northern U.S.A. and Canada often are developed and maintained by using high minimum-length limits (MLLs). However, the effectiveness of using such MLLs on southern-latitude Muskellunge populations, which have different rates of growth and mortality, warrants further research. The Muskellunge fishery in the New River, Virginia, was managed under a 30-in (75 cm) MLL until 2006 when the MLL was increased to 42 in (105 cm) to increase the abundance of large Muskellunge. We measured fishery quality before and after the institution of the 42-in MLL using size structure, average individual condition, rates of growth and mortality, and CPUE. We also assessed the potential of alternative length regulations (other MLLs and a 40–48-in protected-slot limit) to improve the population's size structure and trophy production using simulation models in the Fisheries Analyses and Modeling Simulator (FAMS) program. Following the institution of the 42-in MLL, we observed a 5-in increase in the average size of Muskellunge, an increase in the population's size structure with greater proportions of memorable-size individuals (≥42 in) and an increase in the abundance of memorable-size Muskellunge. However, declines in the average condition, i.e., relative weight (W r ), of large Muskellunge (≥38 in) suggest there is possible stockpiling of individuals just below the 42-in length limit. Higher MLLs (e.g., 48-in MLL) could further improve fishery quality by increasing the survival of Muskellunge to large trophy sizes (≥50 in). However, managers should be wary of stockpiling under alternative MLLs as well. Furthermore, a higher MLL is unlikely to garner broad angler support in this system. Conversely, a protected-slot limit that allows the production of some trophy-sized Muskellunge while reducing the overall number of individuals, and that limits potential for stockpiling, may be a more agreeable regulatory option for New River fishery managers. These findings and the methods described within this study may be useful for fisheries managers working on other Muskellunge fisheries in southern systems.},

abstract = {Abstract: Blue catfish(Ictalurus furcatus) were first detected in the Altamaha River, Georgia, during an access creel survey in 2005 and subsequent- ly in 2006 during annual ictalurid sampling. Introduction of this species in the Altamaha River is believed to have occurred via escape from nor- mal upstream reservoir releases from Lake Sinclair and Lake Oconee. Relative abundance, as indexed by electrofishing catch rate (fis h pe r hour), has increased from 2.9 ± 1.0 SE in 2006 to 38.8 ± 8.2 SE in 2011. The size of blue catfish captured ranged from 56 to 820 mm total length and 0.001 to 7.7 kg. Using otoliths obtained in 2010 (n = 214), age of fish ranged from 0 to 6 yrs, which indicated a relatively young population. The catch-curve analysis resulted in an instantaneous mortality rate (Z) of 0.75. Despite concerns of blue catfish predation on native fishes and mussels, a diet analysis of blue catfish (n =257) obtained in 2010 revealed that diets of fish in all size groups were dominated by the introduced Asiatic clam (Corbicula fluminea). This study describes a recently introduced blue catfish population in an Atlantic coastal plain river and provides insight on possible ecological effects during the early phases of establishment. These results offer an early status assessment of the invasion dynamics before the system has had time to reach a new equilibrium state.},

abstract = {Stomachs of 171 muskellunge (Esox masquinongy) ranging in length from 358 to 1270 mm were examined to evaluate fish diet and to estimate through bioenergetics modeling the predatory impact of muskellunge on smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) in the New River, Virginia. Fifty-five percent of muskellunge stomachs examined contained food. Ninety percent of muskellunge stomachs that contained food contained fewer than six items. Muskellunge exhibited an ontogerietic shift in diet at approximately 800 to 900 mm, changing from a diet consisting primarily of cyprinids to one consisting primarily of catostomids. Smallmouth bass comprised a relatively minor (4{\%} by wet weight) component of muskellunge diet overall, although consumption of smallmouth bass did increase with muskellunge length. At an initial abundance of 100 age-1 fish, muskellunge were estimated to consume 0.18 kg.ha(-1.)yr(-1) of smallmouth bass. In contrast, muskellunge would consume 0.63, 0.31, and 0.43 kg(.)ha(-1.)yr(-1) of catostomids, cyprinids, and lepomids. Given that muskellunge currently are stocked in the New River as fingerlings (=100 mm), post-stocking survival of muskellunge is probably low ({\textless} 10{\%}), thus muskellunge predation likely has little overall impact on New River smallmouth bass stocks. In systems where muskellunge stocking is controversial because of possible predatory impacts on other aquatic species, formulating stocking rates based on acceptable losses to muskellunge predation may help to prevent or resolve stakeholder conflicts.},

abstract = {The muskellunge is an economically important and often declining sport fish restricted to eastern and central North America. To assist research and management, especially in the Georgian Bay area, a conceptual model of muskellunge spawning habitat was developed from a meta-analysis of available peer-reviewed and technical literature. The model incorporates three primary variables: water temperature (7.5-15 o C), dissolved oxygen ({\textgreater} 5 mg/L) at the sediment-water interface, and adequate separation of individual eggs after deposition. The model also assumes that muskellunge spawning occurs in wetlands because of their known association with aquatic vegetation. Secondary variables influencing primary conditions include (1) depth, current and substrate colour (assumed to have an effect on temperature); (2) current, sediment oxygen demand, sediment compactness and plant density (assumed to have an effect on dissolved oxygen concentrations); and (3) particle size and plant density (assumed to have an effect on egg separation). Field validation of these results will help to clarify the relative importance of each variable, and thus allow for refinement of the model.},
